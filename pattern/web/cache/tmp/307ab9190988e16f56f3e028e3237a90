Robinhood saw its revenues soar from $277.5 million in 2019 to $985.8 million in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s first-quarter numbers are even more impressive. During the first three months of 2021, Robinhood generated revenues of $522.2 million, up around four times from its Q1 2020 result of $127.6 million. TechCrunch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom\/\">expected Robinhood to post a strong first quarter<\/a> based on previous filings relating to its payment-for-order-flow (PFOF) business.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, Robinhood was profitable in 2020, generating net income of around $7.4 million during the one-year period. However, the company&#8217;s most recent period includes an epic $1.49 billion cost relating to &#8220;change[s] in fair value of convertible notes and warrant liability,&#8221; leading the company to post an astronomical net loss of $1.44 billion in the first quarter of the year. That compares with a net loss of $107 million for 2019.<\/p>\n<p>For the three-month period ended March 31, Robinhood posted $463.8 million in operating expenses, inclusive of &#8220;brokerage and transaction&#8221; costs. The company&#8217;s business then, apart from its fair-value changes, had a good start to the year in profitability terms.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vrfp2sMfYl\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom\/\">Robinhood&#8217;s epic Q1 growth explains its fundraising boom<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Robinhood&#8217;s epic Q1 growth explains its fundraising boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom\/embed\/#?secret=vrfp2sMfYl\" data-secret=\"vrfp2sMfYl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>That Robinhood closed the first quarter of 2021 on a more than $2 billion annual run rate is notable; the firm has quickly scaled to mammoth size on the back of rising consumer interest in investing in both stocks and cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>Robinhood has proved to be a lightning rod for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/18\/robinhood-goes-to-congress\/\">oversight<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finra.org\/media-center\/newsreleases\/2021\/finra-orders-record-financial-penalties-against-robinhood-financial\">fines<\/a>, mass usage and culture in the last year.

considers new features for tweeting only to friends, under different personas and more"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Twitter has a history of sharing feature and design ideas it&#8217;s considering at very early stages of development. Earlier this month, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/15\/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions\/\">it showed off<\/a> concepts around a potential &#8220;unmention&#8221; feature that would let users untag themselves from others&#8217; tweets. Today, the company is <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/a_dsgnr\">sharing<\/a> a few more of its design explorations that would allow users to better control who can see their tweets and who ends up in their replies. The new concepts include a way to tweet only to a group of trusted friends, new prompts that would ask people to reconsider the language they&#8217;re using when posting a reply, and a &#8220;personas&#8221; feature that would allow you to tweet based on your different contexts &#8212; like tweets about your work life, your hobbies and interests, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>The company says it&#8217;s thinking through these concepts and is looking to now gather feedback to inform what it may later develop.<\/p>\n<p>The first of the new ideas builds on work that began last year with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets\/\">the release of a feature<\/a> that allows an original poster to choose who&#8217;s allowed to reply to their tweet. Today, users can choose to limit replies to only people mentioned in the tweet, only people they follow, or they can leave it defaulted to &#8220;everyone.&#8221; But even though this allows users to limit who can respond, everyone can see the tweet itself. And they can like, retweet or quote tweet the post.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>With the proposed Trusted Friends feature, users could tweet to a group of their own choosing. This could be a way to use Twitter with real-life friends, or some other small network of people you know more personally. Perhaps you could post a tweet that only your New York friends could see when you wanted to let them know you were in town. Or maybe you could post only to those who share your love of a particular TV show, sporting event or hobby.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2172835\" style=\"width: 651px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2172835\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2172835\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?w=641\" alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png 800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=141,150 141w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=283,300 283w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=768,815 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=641,680 641w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=47,50 47w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2172835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Twitter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>This ability to have private conversations alongside public ones could boost people&#8217;s Twitter usage and even encourage some people to try tweeting for the first time. But it also could be disruptive to Twitter, as it would chip away at the company&#8217;s original idea of a platform that&#8217;s a sort of public message board where everyone is invited into the conversation. Users may begin to think about whether their post is worthy of being shared in public and decide to hold more of their content back from the wider Twitter audience, which could impact Twitter engagement metrics. It also pushes Twitter closer to Facebook territory where only some posts are meant for the world, while more are shared with just friends.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter says the benefit of this private, &#8220;friends only&#8221; format is that it could save people from the workarounds they&#8217;re currently using &#8212; like juggling multiple alt accounts or toggling between public to protected tweets.<\/p>\n<p>Another new feature under consideration is Reply Language Prompts. This feature would allow Twitter users to choose phrases they don&#8217;t want to see in their replies. When someone is writing back to the original poster, these words and phrases would be highlighted and a prompt would explain why the original poster doesn&#8217;t want to see that sort of language. For instance, users could configure prompts to appear if someone is using profanity in their reply.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2172833\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2172833\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2172833 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png 800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?resize=150,85 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?resize=768,433 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2172833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits: Twitter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The feature wouldn&#8217;t stop the poster from tweeting their reply &#8212; it&#8217;s more a gentle nudge that asks them to be more considerate.<\/p>\n<p>These &#8220;nudges&#8221; can have impact. For example, when Twitter launched a nudge <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/twitter-read-before-retweet\/\">that suggested users read an article<\/a> before they amplify it with a retweet, it found that users opened articles before sharing them 40% more often. But in the case of someone determined to troll, it may not do that much good.<\/p>\n<p>The third, and perhaps most complicated, feature is something Twitter is calling &#8220;Facets.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is an early idea about tweeting from different personas from one account. The feature would make sense for those who often tweet about different aspects of their lives, including their work life, their side hustles, their personal life or family, their passions and more.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2172836\" style=\"width: 668px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2172836\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2172836\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?w=658\" alt=\"\" width=\"658\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png 800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=145,150 145w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=290,300 290w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=768,794 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=658,680 658w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=48,50 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2172836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Twitter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Unlike Trusted Friends, which would let you restrict some tweets to a more personal network, Facets would give other users the ability to choose whether they wanted to follow all your tweets, or only those about the &#8220;facet&#8221; they&#8217;re interested in. This way, you could follow someone&#8217;s tweets about tech, but ignore their stream of reactions they post when watching their favorite team play. Or you could follow your friend&#8217;s personal tweets, but ignore their work-related content. And so on.<\/p>\n<p>This is an interesting idea, as Twitter users have always worried about alienating some of their followers by posting &#8220;off-topic&#8221; so to speak. But this also puts the problem of determining what tweets to show which users on the end user themselves. Users may be better served by the algorithmic timeline that understands which content they engage with, and which they tend to ignore. (Also: &#8220;facets\u203d&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>Twitter says none of the three features are in the process of being built just yet. These are only design mockups that showcase ideas the company has been considering. It also hasn&#8217;t yet made the decision whether any of the three will go under development &#8212; that&#8217;s what the user feedback it&#8217;s hoping to receive will help to determine.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TZvu6rAfn3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/28\/summer-sale-save-10-on-extra-crunch-membership\/\">Summer Sale: Save 10% on Extra Crunch membership<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Summer Sale: Save 10% on Extra Crunch membership&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/28\/summer-sale-save-10-on-extra-crunch-membership\/embed\/#?secret=TZvu6rAfn3\" data-secret=\"TZvu6rAfn3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter has a history of sharing feature and design ideas it&#8217;s considering at very early stages of development.

they&#8217;ve raised $30 million in a Series B bout of funding led by FunPlus Ventures with additional participation from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), LVP, Transcend, Anthos Capital and Mitch Lasky. The studio has now disclosed some $49 million in funding, a sizable sum, but one that showcases how much investors are looking to rally around gaming platform plays in the wake of Roblox&#8217;s monster IPO.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, Singularity 6 raised a $16.5 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz. At the time, the studio was mum on details about its upcoming debut title, but we&#8217;ve learned more about it since.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The title, Palia, is a community simulation game that seems to be more focused on Animal Crossing-like community mechanics in an MMO environment, rather than endless battles. Last month, the studio showcased a launch trailer of the title which hinted at a good deal of the gameplay. Palia looks to be a medieval Zelda-like environment where users can move between towns in an open world environment while farming and collecting resources to build structures in a shared world.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/lP009fvbt8c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The company has said in marketing materials that the title is &#8220;designed to create community, friendships and a real sense of belonging.&#8221; In a statement, a16z partner Jonathan Lai called the upcoming title, &#8220;warm and dynamic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There are still quite a bit of unanswered questions about the title, which is currently taking sign-ups on its website to be alerted to pre-alpha access.

financial services as a challenge for banks in the South Asian market, saying the growing presence of these firms have prompted concerns about creation of an uneven playing field.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?UrlPage=&amp;ID=1174\">report<\/a> published on Thursday, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said Big Tech offers a wide range of digital services that hold the promise of supporting financial inclusion, generating lasting efficiency gains, and making banks become more competitive, but their expansion in the financial services sector has given rise to \u201cimportant policy issues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSpecifically, concerns have intensified around a level playing field with banks, operational risk, too-big-to-fail issues, challenges for antitrust rules, cybersecurity and data privacy,\u201d the Indian central bank wrote.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Big Tech firms \u201cstraddle many different (nonfinancial) lines of business with sometimes opaque overarching governance structures&#8221; and have the potential to become \u201cthe dominant players&#8221; in financial services, wrote the central bank, which also regulates the finance market in India. \u201cThird, Big Tech [companies] are generally able to overcome limits to scale in financial services provision by exploiting network effects.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For central banks and financial regulators, financial stability objectives may be best pursued by blending activity and entity-based prudential regulation of Big Tech [companies] (an activity-based approach is already applied in areas such as anti-money laundering\/combating the financing of terrorism; an activity-based approach is the provision of cloud services, where minimising operational and in particular, cyber risk is paramount).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFurthermore, as the digital economy expands across borders, international coordination of rules and standards becomes more pressing,\u201d it added. Worth noting that it&#8217;s not clear how RBI defines Big Tech: Is it referring to American tech giants? Does it also see Reliance Industries and Tata Group, two Indian conglomerates that are also slowly making their way into financial services, as Big Tech?<\/p>\n<p>The caution comes at a time when the RBI, which in the past decade opened up the mobile payments through a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model\/\">retail banks-backed infrastructure called UPI<\/a> in the past decade, is now opening up the entire national payment network in the country.<\/p>\n<p>A number of players including the tech giants Facebook, Google and Amazon and plastic card processing firms Visa and Mastercard have applied for licenses to operate retail payments and settlement systems in the country. (RBI is expected to give some of these firms licenses later this year.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Nowhere else in the world would the largest corporates, banks [and] telcos in India and the largest tech players in the world would come together to build national payment networks.&#8221; analysts at Bernstein said of the NUE.<\/p>\n<p>An industry executive questioned the concerns raised by RBI, saying no existing rule is preventing the big banks in India &#8212; ICICI and HDFC &#8212; that already amass a plethora of data about their customers from investing in their digital expansion.<\/p>\n<p>State Bank of India \u201cis nearly a quarter of Indian banking. And Yono [State Bank of India&#8217;s digital bank platform] claims a $40 billion market valuation. Why is their reach not a concern?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said big technology firms are following the regulations set by the RBI. They are using rails built by banks and are required to operate in the space only through partnerships with banks. \u201cThe RBI is free to make more regulations &#8212; and it\u2019s already doing so with wallet KYC restrictions and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/05\/google-and-walmart-face-growth-hurdles-as-india-caps-payments-transactions\/\">imposing market share caps<\/a> for those doing payments atop UPI infrastructure.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ABsX6hRTHt\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/10\/the-fintech-endgame-new-supercompanies-combine-the-best-of-software-and-financials\/\">The fintech endgame: New supercompanies combine the best of software and financials<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The fintech endgame: New supercompanies combine the best of software and financials&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/10\/the-fintech-endgame-new-supercompanies-combine-the-best-of-software-and-financials\/embed\/#?secret=ABsX6hRTHt\" data-secret=\"ABsX6hRTHt\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>India\u2019s central bank has identified Big Tech&#8217;s push into financial services as a challenge for banks in the South Asian market, saying the growing presence of these firms have prompted concerns about creation of an uneven playing field.

href=\"https:\/\/www.microverse.org\/\">Microverse<\/a> has tapped new venture funding in its quest to help train students across the globe to code through its online school which requires zero upfront cost, instead relying on an income-share agreement which kicks in when students find a job.<\/p>\n<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it has closed a $12.5 million Series A led by Northzone with additional participation from General Catalyst, All Iron Ventures and a host of angel investors. We last covered the company after it had closed a bout of seed funding from General Catalysts and Y Combinator; this latest round brings the startup&#8217;s total funding to just under $16 million.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1xDYoJo5zz\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/25\/investors-bet-millions-on-microverse-a-lambda-school-for-the-developing-world\/\">VCs bet millions on Microverse, a Lambda School for the developing world<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;VCs bet millions on Microverse, a Lambda School for the developing world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/25\/investors-bet-millions-on-microverse-a-lambda-school-for-the-developing-world\/embed\/#?secret=1xDYoJo5zz\" data-secret=\"1xDYoJo5zz\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The company&#8217;s vision has seen added pandemic era traction as larger tech companies have embraced remote work that spans geographic boundaries and time zones. Microverse has now brought English-speaking students from over 188 countries through its program.<\/p>\n<p>Since we last chatted, CEO Ariel Camus says the startup has landed some 300 early graduates in positions at tech companies including Microsoft, VMWare and Huawei. The company says its has above a 95% employment rate for its students within six months of graduation so far, pushing past one of the bigger issues that income-share agreement-based schools have had stateside &#8212; getting graduates employed.<\/p>\n<p>Microverse does have notably less generous terms than counterparts like Lambda School when it comes to when students begin loan repayment, the terms of both are actually quite different, as noted in my previous article.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While Lambda School\u2019s ISA terms require students to pay 17% of their monthly salary for 24 months once they begin earning above $50,000 annually \u2014 up to a maximum of $30,000, Microverse requires that graduates pay 15% of their salary once they begin making more than just $1,000 per month, though there is no cap on time, so students continue payments until they have repaid $15,000 in full. In both startups\u2019 cases, students only repay if they are employed in a field related to what they studied, but with Microverse, ISAs never expire, so if you ever enter a job adjacent to your area of study, you are on the hook for repayments. Lambda School\u2019s ISA taps out after five years of deferred repayments.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The startup has made efforts to streamline their online program since launch to ensure that students are being set up to succeed in the full-time, 10-month program. Part of Microverse&#8217;s efforts have included condensing lesson segments into shorter time frames to ensure students aren&#8217;t starting the program unless they have enough free time to commit. Camus says the startup is receiving thousands of applications per month, of which only a fraction are accepted in an effort to ensure that the small startup isn&#8217;t overcommitting itself early on. The startup estimates it will usher 1,000 students through its program this year.<\/p>\n<p>The startup has big plans for the future, including working more closely with tech companies to ensure that students have easier access to job placement once they graduate.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have data now that the day we launch a partner program &#8212; which we haven&#8217;t done yet but we will eventually &#8212; it opens up the market by 5X,&#8221; Camus tells TechCrunch. &#8220;To get 10,000 students per year in a world where 90% of the world&#8217;s population doesn&#8217;t have access to higher education &#8212; it&#8217;s not going to be that hard, to be honest, I&#8217;m not too worried.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"QLj06LiNuT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/29\/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring\/\">Lambda School lays off 65 employees amid restructuring<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Lambda School lays off 65 employees amid restructuring&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/29\/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring\/embed\/#?secret=QLj06LiNuT\" data-secret=\"QLj06LiNuT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Edtech startup Microverse has tapped new venture funding in its quest to help train students across the globe to code through its online school which requires zero upfront cost, instead relying on an income-share agreement which kicks in when students find a job.

What&#8217;s more, the systems created to prevent the misuse and mishandling of sensitive data often depend heavily on someone&#8217;s better angels.<\/p>\n<p>According to Sid Trivedi, a partner at Foundation Capital, and seven-time CIO Mark Settle, IT managers need to replace existing DLP frameworks with a new one that centers on DMP \u2014 data misuse protection.<\/p>\n<p>These solutions &#8220;will provide data assets with more sophisticated self-defense mechanisms instead of relying on the surveillance of traditional security perimeters,&#8221; and many startups are already competing in this space.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5c1xous20z\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/01\/to-guard-against-data-loss-and-misuse-the-cybersecurity-conversation-must-evolve\/\">To guard against data loss and misuse, the cybersecurity conversation must evolve<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;To guard against data loss and misuse, the cybersecurity conversation must evolve&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/01\/to-guard-against-data-loss-and-misuse-the-cybersecurity-conversation-must-evolve\/embed\/#?secret=5c1xous20z\" data-secret=\"5c1xous20z\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><em>(Extra Crunch is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/\"> <em>You can sign up here<\/em><\/a><em>.)<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Big Tech Inc.<\/h2>\n<p>We revisited some themes we\u2019ve seen before in our startup section. The same goes for our look at Big Tech. On the government-and-tech side of things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/01\/indias-central-bank-says-growing-presence-of-big-tech-in-financial-services-a-concern\/\">India doesn\u2019t appreciate Big Tech companies, part 47:<\/a><\/strong> Manish Singh reports that \u201cIndia\u2019s central bank has identified Big Tech\u2019s push into financial services as a challenge for banks in the South Asian market, saying the growing presence of these firms have prompted concerns about creation of an uneven playing field.\u201d Recall that India is also irked at Twitter and has various other beefs with different tech companies.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/01\/paris-court-fines-airbnb-9-6-million-for-illegal-listings\/\">Paris fines Airbnb:<\/a> <\/strong>Sticking to the government theme, Airbnb got hit with an \u20ac8 million fine today, a fee worth 0.14% of the company\u2019s $6.6 billion in cash it held at the end of the first quarter, per its <a href=\"https:\/\/s26.q4cdn.com\/656283129\/files\/doc_financials\/2021\/q1\/Airbnb_Q1-2021-Shareholder-Letter_Final.pdf\">latest earnings report<\/a>. The Daily Crunch would like to congratulate the City of Light on its auspicious regulatory victory.<\/li>\n<li>Lastly, from Pinterest, something that stood out while going back through the day\u2019s news: <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/01\/pinterest-updates-policy-to-prohibit-ads-promoting-weight-loss\/\">A prohibition of weight-loss advertising<\/a>. Lots of folks struggle with eating disorders, body image and related issues. So Pinterest is doing away with one type of advertisement that might harm those folks. With decisions like this we don\u2019t want to be overly kind to the company in question as we don\u2019t know how much money it is leaving on the table, but the move could hint at more active social media regulation of owned platforms in the future. At least when it comes to ads.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>TechCrunch Experts: Growth Marketing<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2159841\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2159841\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2159841\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration montage based on education and knowledge in blue\" width=\"1024\" height=\"643\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg?resize=768,482 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg?resize=680,427 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/GettyImages-1009465486.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2159841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gettyimages.com\/search\/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=SEAN+GLADWELL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEAN GLADWELL <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a> \/ Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re reaching out to startup founders to tell us who they turn to when they want the most up-to-date growth marketing practices. <a href=\"https:\/\/oathtechevents.typeform.com\/to\/bwwIWF03\">Fill out the survey here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Read one of the recommendations we\u2019ve received below!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Name of marketer: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/amykonefal\/\">Amy Konefal<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Name of recommender: <\/strong>Dan Reardon, formerly of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vudu.com\/\">vudu.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation:<\/strong>\u00a0 \u201cAmy drove scale for us as we grew to a half-billion-dollar company.

The $1.05-billion mark in the report is spread across 111 transactions \u2014 there were 237 in 2020, so we could expect a similar total this year. More funding and stable deal count of course means that we are seeing significant increases in deal size.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tIt seems generalist investors are recognizing that edtech investments can reap outsized returns, similar to sectors like deep tech, health tech and fintech.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>We can draw a few conclusions from this. We can construe that companies created last year and in previous years matured significantly during the pandemic due to increased demand. Moreover, this rapid natural selection process provided insights on verticals and possible winners.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, it seems generalist investors are recognizing that edtech investments can reap outsized returns, similar to sectors like deep tech, health tech and fintech.<\/p>\n<p>This is contributing to larger early rounds than we have seen in previous years \u2014 investors can\u2019t pick the winner, but they can slant the playing field instead. We therefore expect to see a surge in the number of pre-seed, seed and Series A rounds in the second half of 2021, as companies founded during the pandemic begin to raise meaningful funding.<\/p>\n<p>Another reason that edtech is being taken seriously by generalist investors is that the true size of the market (and the extent of digitization to come) is becoming more conceivable.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2172794\" style=\"width: 1280px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2172794\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2172794 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Media-edtech-comparison-charts.png\" alt=\"Spending on edtech is undergoing a similar growth to that of media spending in 2010\" width=\"1270\" height=\"557\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Media-edtech-comparison-charts.png 1270w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Media-edtech-comparison-charts.png?resize=150,66 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Media-edtech-comparison-charts.png?resize=300,132 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Media-edtech-comparison-charts.png?resize=768,337 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Media-edtech-comparison-charts.png?resize=680,298 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Media-edtech-comparison-charts.png?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1270px) 100vw, 1270px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2172794\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Edtech spending is growing like media spending did in the 2010s.<strong> Image Credits:<\/strong> Brighteye Ventures<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are seeing a wave of private companies sweeping across parts of education and training that were previously overseen or funded centrally by governments.

Now that we&#8217;ve done a first dig, we can take the time to dive into the company&#8217;s filing more deeply.<\/p>\n<p>Robinhood&#8217;s IPO has long been anticipated not only because there are billions of dollars in capital riding on its impending liquidity, but also because the company became something of a poster child for the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/17\/saving-not-spending-is-the-new-hotness-in-fintech\/\">savings and investing boom<\/a> that 2020 saw and the COVID-19 pandemic helped engender.<\/p>\n<p>The consumer trading service&#8217;s products became so popular and enmeshed in popular culture thanks to both the &#8220;stonks&#8221; movement and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/27\/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader\/\">the larger GameStop brouhaha<\/a>, that the company&#8217;s public offering carries much more weight than that of a more regular venture-backed entity. Robinhood has fans, haters, and many an observer in Congress.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of all that, today we are digging into the company&#8217;s business and financial results. So, if you want to better understand how Robinhood makes money, and how profitable or not it really is, this is for you.<\/p>\n<p>We will start with a more in-depth look at growth and profitability, pivot to learning about the company&#8217;s revenue makeup, discuss a risk factor or two, and close on its decision to offer some of its own shares to its users.

considers new features for tweeting only to friends, under different personas and more"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Twitter has a history of sharing feature and design ideas it&#8217;s considering at very early stages of development. Earlier this month, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/15\/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions\/\">it showed off<\/a> concepts around a potential &#8220;unmention&#8221; feature that would let users untag themselves from others&#8217; tweets. Today, the company is <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/a_dsgnr\">sharing<\/a> a few more of its design explorations that would allow users to better control who can see their tweets and who ends up in their replies. The new concepts include a way to tweet only to a group of trusted friends, new prompts that would ask people to reconsider the language they&#8217;re using when posting a reply, and a &#8220;personas&#8221; feature that would allow you to tweet based on your different contexts &#8212; like tweets about your work life, your hobbies and interests, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>The company says it&#8217;s thinking through these concepts and is looking to now gather feedback to inform what it may later develop.<\/p>\n<p>The first of the new ideas builds on work that began last year with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/11\/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets\/\">the release of a feature<\/a> that allows an original poster to choose who&#8217;s allowed to reply to their tweet. Today, users can choose to limit replies to only people mentioned in the tweet, only people they follow, or they can leave it defaulted to &#8220;everyone.&#8221; But even though this allows users to limit who can respond, everyone can see the tweet itself. And they can like, retweet or quote tweet the post.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>With the proposed Trusted Friends feature, users could tweet to a group of their own choosing. This could be a way to use Twitter with real-life friends, or some other small network of people you know more personally. Perhaps you could post a tweet that only your New York friends could see when you wanted to let them know you were in town. Or maybe you could post only to those who share your love of a particular TV show, sporting event or hobby.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2172835\" style=\"width: 651px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2172835\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2172835\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?w=641\" alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png 800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=141,150 141w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=283,300 283w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=768,815 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=641,680 641w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/trustedfriends-full.png?resize=47,50 47w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2172835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Twitter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>This ability to have private conversations alongside public ones could boost people&#8217;s Twitter usage and even encourage some people to try tweeting for the first time. But it also could be disruptive to Twitter, as it would chip away at the company&#8217;s original idea of a platform that&#8217;s a sort of public message board where everyone is invited into the conversation. Users may begin to think about whether their post is worthy of being shared in public and decide to hold more of their content back from the wider Twitter audience, which could impact Twitter engagement metrics. It also pushes Twitter closer to Facebook territory where only some posts are meant for the world, while more are shared with just friends.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter says the benefit of this private, &#8220;friends only&#8221; format is that it could save people from the workarounds they&#8217;re currently using &#8212; like juggling multiple alt accounts or toggling between public to protected tweets.<\/p>\n<p>Another new feature under consideration is Reply Language Prompts. This feature would allow Twitter users to choose phrases they don&#8217;t want to see in their replies. When someone is writing back to the original poster, these words and phrases would be highlighted and a prompt would explain why the original poster doesn&#8217;t want to see that sort of language. For instance, users could configure prompts to appear if someone is using profanity in their reply.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2172833\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2172833\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2172833 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png 800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?resize=150,85 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?resize=768,433 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/smellcheck-full.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2172833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits: Twitter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The feature wouldn&#8217;t stop the poster from tweeting their reply &#8212; it&#8217;s more a gentle nudge that asks them to be more considerate.<\/p>\n<p>These &#8220;nudges&#8221; can have impact. For example, when Twitter launched a nudge <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/twitter-read-before-retweet\/\">that suggested users read an article<\/a> before they amplify it with a retweet, it found that users opened articles before sharing them 40% more often. But in the case of someone determined to troll, it may not do that much good.<\/p>\n<p>The third, and perhaps most complicated, feature is something Twitter is calling &#8220;Facets.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is an early idea about tweeting from different personas from one account. The feature would make sense for those who often tweet about different aspects of their lives, including their work life, their side hustles, their personal life or family, their passions and more.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2172836\" style=\"width: 668px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2172836\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2172836\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?w=658\" alt=\"\" width=\"658\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png 800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=145,150 145w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=290,300 290w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=768,794 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=658,680 658w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/facets-full.png?resize=48,50 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2172836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Twitter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Unlike Trusted Friends, which would let you restrict some tweets to a more personal network, Facets would give other users the ability to choose whether they wanted to follow all your tweets, or only those about the &#8220;facet&#8221; they&#8217;re interested in. This way, you could follow someone&#8217;s tweets about tech, but ignore their stream of reactions they post when watching their favorite team play. Or you could follow your friend&#8217;s personal tweets, but ignore their work-related content. And so on.<\/p>\n<p>This is an interesting idea, as Twitter users have always worried about alienating some of their followers by posting &#8220;off-topic&#8221; so to speak. But this also puts the problem of determining what tweets to show which users on the end user themselves. Users may be better served by the algorithmic timeline that understands which content they engage with, and which they tend to ignore. (Also: &#8220;facets\u203d&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>Twitter says none of the three features are in the process of being built just yet. These are only design mockups that showcase ideas the company has been considering. It also hasn&#8217;t yet made the decision whether any of the three will go under development &#8212; that&#8217;s what the user feedback it&#8217;s hoping to receive will help to determine.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TZvu6rAfn3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/28\/summer-sale-save-10-on-extra-crunch-membership\/\">Summer Sale: Save 10% on Extra Crunch membership<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Summer Sale: Save 10% on Extra Crunch membership&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/28\/summer-sale-save-10-on-extra-crunch-membership\/embed\/#?secret=TZvu6rAfn3\" data-secret=\"TZvu6rAfn3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter has a history of sharing feature and design ideas it&#8217;s considering at very early stages of development.

They\u2019re surrounded by networks, endpoint devices and human beings that serve as moats, defining the defensive security perimeters of every organization. Conventional solutions assign sensitivity ratings to individual data assets and monitor these perimeters to detect the unauthorized movement of sensitive data.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tIt\u2019s painfully clear that existing data loss prevention (DLP) tools are struggling to deal with the data sprawl, ubiquitous cloud services, device diversity and human behaviors that constitute our virtual world.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these historical security boundaries are becoming increasingly ambiguous and somewhat irrelevant as bots, APIs and collaboration tools become the primary conduits for sharing and exchanging data.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, data loss is only half the problem confronting a modern enterprise. Corporations are routinely exposed to financial, legal and ethical risks associated with the mishandling or misuse of sensitive information within the corporation itself. The risks associated with the misuse of personally identifiable information have been widely publicized.<\/p>\n<p>However, risks of similar or greater severity can result from the mishandling of intellectual property, material nonpublic information, or any type of data that was obtained through a formal agreement that placed explicit restrictions on its use.<\/p>\n<p>Conventional DLP frameworks are incapable of addressing these challenges. We believe they need to be replaced by a new <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/work-bench\/cio-perspectives-with-mark-settle-nextgen-dlp-data-misuse-protection-e2d6335517aa\">data misuse protection (DMP) framework<\/a> that safeguards data from unauthorized or inappropriate use <i>within <\/i>a corporate environment <i>in addition to <\/i>its outright theft or inadvertent loss. DMP solutions will provide data assets with more sophisticated self-defense mechanisms instead of relying on the surveillance of traditional security perimeters.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>People \u2014 not applications, networks or endpoints \u2014 have become the primary security perimeter in today\u2019s cloud-first, choose-the-handiest-device, collaboration-obsessed world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574447,"featured_media":2172839,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"9aa553cb-a92e-358c-88c5-2ef16922e508"},"categories":[25515,449557044,21587494,20429],"tags":[576757729,1715866,576747132,8159,25818,69804,91484,576846312,576849089,576846311,576692005,576794629],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796356],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/jose-fontano-pZld9PiPDno-unsplash.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3Al7qEf","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.37,"featured":true,"subtitle":"It's time for data assets to start protecting themselves","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2172700,2052125],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2172640"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2172640"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2172640\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2172867,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2172640\/revisions\/2172867"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/sid-trivedi"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/mark-settle"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2172640&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574447"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2172839"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2172640"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2172640"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2172640"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2172640"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2172640"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2172640"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2172640"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2172700,"name":"Sid Trivedi","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/sid-trivedi\/","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/siddhanttrivedi\/\">Sid Trivedi<\/a> is a partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/foundationcapital.com\/\">Foundation Capital<\/a> where he leads cybersecurity and IT investments.

financial services as a challenge for banks in the South Asian market, saying the growing presence of these firms have prompted concerns about creation of an uneven playing field.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?UrlPage=&amp;ID=1174\">report<\/a> published on Thursday, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said Big Tech offers a wide range of digital services that hold the promise of supporting financial inclusion, generating lasting efficiency gains, and making banks become more competitive, but their expansion in the financial services sector has given rise to \u201cimportant policy issues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSpecifically, concerns have intensified around a level playing field with banks, operational risk, too-big-to-fail issues, challenges for antitrust rules, cybersecurity and data privacy,\u201d the Indian central bank wrote.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Big Tech firms \u201cstraddle many different (nonfinancial) lines of business with sometimes opaque overarching governance structures&#8221; and have the potential to become \u201cthe dominant players&#8221; in financial services, wrote the central bank, which also regulates the finance market in India. \u201cThird, Big Tech [companies] are generally able to overcome limits to scale in financial services provision by exploiting network effects.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For central banks and financial regulators, financial stability objectives may be best pursued by blending activity and entity-based prudential regulation of Big Tech [companies] (an activity-based approach is already applied in areas such as anti-money laundering\/combating the financing of terrorism; an activity-based approach is the provision of cloud services, where minimising operational and in particular, cyber risk is paramount).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFurthermore, as the digital economy expands across borders, international coordination of rules and standards becomes more pressing,\u201d it added. Worth noting that it&#8217;s not clear how RBI defines Big Tech: Is it referring to American tech giants? Does it also see Reliance Industries and Tata Group, two Indian conglomerates that are also slowly making their way into financial services, as Big Tech?<\/p>\n<p>The caution comes at a time when the RBI, which in the past decade opened up the mobile payments through a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model\/\">retail banks-backed infrastructure called UPI<\/a> in the past decade, is now opening up the entire national payment network in the country.<\/p>\n<p>A number of players including the tech giants Facebook, Google and Amazon and plastic card processing firms Visa and Mastercard have applied for licenses to operate retail payments and settlement systems in the country. (RBI is expected to give some of these firms licenses later this year.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Nowhere else in the world would the largest corporates, banks [and] telcos in India and the largest tech players in the world would come together to build national payment networks.&#8221; analysts at Bernstein said of the NUE.<\/p>\n<p>An industry executive questioned the concerns raised by RBI, saying no existing rule is preventing the big banks in India &#8212; ICICI and HDFC &#8212; that already amass a plethora of data about their customers from investing in their digital expansion.<\/p>\n<p>State Bank of India \u201cis nearly a quarter of Indian banking. And Yono [State Bank of India&#8217;s digital bank platform] claims a $40 billion market valuation. Why is their reach not a concern?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said big technology firms are following the regulations set by the RBI. They are using rails built by banks and are required to operate in the space only through partnerships with banks. \u201cThe RBI is free to make more regulations &#8212; and it\u2019s already doing so with wallet KYC restrictions and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/05\/google-and-walmart-face-growth-hurdles-as-india-caps-payments-transactions\/\">imposing market share caps<\/a> for those doing payments atop UPI infrastructure.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ABsX6hRTHt\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/10\/the-fintech-endgame-new-supercompanies-combine-the-best-of-software-and-financials\/\">The fintech endgame: New supercompanies combine the best of software and financials<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The fintech endgame: New supercompanies combine the best of software and financials&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/10\/the-fintech-endgame-new-supercompanies-combine-the-best-of-software-and-financials\/embed\/#?secret=ABsX6hRTHt\" data-secret=\"ABsX6hRTHt\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>India\u2019s central bank has identified Big Tech&#8217;s push into financial services as a challenge for banks in the South Asian market, saying the growing presence of these firms have prompted concerns about creation of an uneven playing field.

court fines Airbnb $9.6 million for illegal listings"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A court in Paris has fined <a href=\"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\">Airbnb<\/a>, the popular marketplace for vacation rentals. According to the court, the tech company has failed to comply with local regulation when it comes to listing your apartment on the platform. Airbnb should pay $9.6 million (\u20ac8.08 million) to the city of Paris.<\/p>\n<p>This decision has been years in the making. Like many major cities around the world, Airbnb has had some impact on the housing market in Paris. Many apartments disappeared from the housing market as they became full-time Airbnb apartments, leading to high rents.<\/p>\n<p>In 2017, it became a bit more difficult to list your home on Airbnb if you live in Paris. For instance, you can\u2019t rent an apartment for more than 120 nights a year. This way, landlords would think twice before switching from full-time tenants to Airbnb customers.<\/p>\n<p>As there are multiple vacation rental platforms, the city of Paris implemented a registration system. If you want to list your apartment on Airbnb, you have to get a registration number first. Platforms like Airbnb would have to ask for that registration number and cap listings to 120 nights per year.<\/p>\n<p>At first, the mayor\u2019s office <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/11\/paris-asks-airbnb-to-delist-a-thousand-apartments\/\">flagged<\/a> around 1,000 apartments that were not properly registered. They sent the list to Airbnb, asking the company to take down those listings.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, the city of Paris <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/11\/paris-sues-airbnb-for-illegal-listings-and-seeks-14-2-million\/\">sued<\/a> Airbnb for the same reason. Thanks to some regulatory changes, the responsibility was shared between the hosts and the platform. And it leads us to today\u2019s fine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the first time in France that a local government wins a case against a tech giant,\u201d Paris Deputy Mayor Ian Brossat said in <a href=\"https:\/\/presse.paris.fr\/pages\/19789\">a statement<\/a>. \u201cPlatforms are finally held accountable. A wonderful win for Parisians.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Airbnb <a href=\"https:\/\/www.20minutes.fr\/paris\/3075139-20210701-paris-airbnb-condamne-verser-huit-millions-euros-premiere-felicite-mairie\">told<\/a> the AFP that 95% of listings in Paris have been reserved for less than 120 nights in the past year. It means that those last 5% of listings represent much more than 5% of nights.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"876R58pcn7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/fifth-walls-brendan-wallace-and-hippos-assaf-wand-discuss-proptechs-biggest-opportunities\/\">Fifth Wall&#8217;s Brendan Wallace and Hippo&#8217;s Assaf Wand discuss proptech&#8217;s biggest opportunities<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Fifth Wall&#8217;s Brendan Wallace and Hippo&#8217;s Assaf Wand discuss proptech&#8217;s biggest opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/fifth-walls-brendan-wallace-and-hippos-assaf-wand-discuss-proptechs-biggest-opportunities\/embed\/#?secret=876R58pcn7\" data-secret=\"876R58pcn7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"sYljUf4B3d\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/11\/paris-asks-airbnb-to-delist-a-thousand-apartments\/\">Paris asks Airbnb to delist 1,000 apartments<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Paris asks Airbnb to delist 1,000 apartments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/11\/paris-asks-airbnb-to-delist-a-thousand-apartments\/embed\/#?secret=sYljUf4B3d\" data-secret=\"sYljUf4B3d\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"r5SUEFUo0L\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/11\/paris-sues-airbnb-for-illegal-listings-and-seeks-14-2-million\/\">Paris sues Airbnb for illegal listings and seeks $14.2 million<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Paris sues Airbnb for illegal listings and seeks $14.2 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/11\/paris-sues-airbnb-for-illegal-listings-and-seeks-14-2-million\/embed\/#?secret=r5SUEFUo0L\" data-secret=\"r5SUEFUo0L\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A court in Paris has fined Airbnb, the popular marketplace for vacation rentals.

Robinhood saw its revenues soar from $277.5 million in 2019 to $985.8 million in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s first-quarter numbers are even more impressive. During the first three months of 2021, Robinhood generated revenues of $522.2 million, up around four times from its Q1 2020 result of $127.6 million. TechCrunch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom\/\">expected Robinhood to post a strong first quarter<\/a> based on previous filings relating to its payment-for-order-flow (PFOF) business.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, Robinhood was profitable in 2020, generating net income of around $7.4 million during the one-year period. However, the company&#8217;s most recent period includes an epic $1.49 billion cost relating to &#8220;change[s] in fair value of convertible notes and warrant liability,&#8221; leading the company to post an astronomical net loss of $1.44 billion in the first quarter of the year. That compares with a net loss of $107 million for 2019.<\/p>\n<p>For the three-month period ended March 31, Robinhood posted $463.8 million in operating expenses, inclusive of &#8220;brokerage and transaction&#8221; costs. The company&#8217;s business then, apart from its fair-value changes, had a good start to the year in profitability terms.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vrfp2sMfYl\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom\/\">Robinhood&#8217;s epic Q1 growth explains its fundraising boom<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Robinhood&#8217;s epic Q1 growth explains its fundraising boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom\/embed\/#?secret=vrfp2sMfYl\" data-secret=\"vrfp2sMfYl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>That Robinhood closed the first quarter of 2021 on a more than $2 billion annual run rate is notable; the firm has quickly scaled to mammoth size on the back of rising consumer interest in investing in both stocks and cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>Robinhood has proved to be a lightning rod for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/18\/robinhood-goes-to-congress\/\">oversight<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finra.org\/media-center\/newsreleases\/2021\/finra-orders-record-financial-penalties-against-robinhood-financial\">fines<\/a>, mass usage and culture in the last year.

they&#8217;ve raised $30 million in a Series B bout of funding led by FunPlus Ventures with additional participation from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), LVP, Transcend, Anthos Capital and Mitch Lasky. The studio has now disclosed some $49 million in funding, a sizable sum, but one that showcases how much investors are looking to rally around gaming platform plays in the wake of Roblox&#8217;s monster IPO.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, Singularity 6 raised a $16.5 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz. At the time, the studio was mum on details about its upcoming debut title, but we&#8217;ve learned more about it since.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The title, Palia, is a community simulation game that seems to be more focused on Animal Crossing-like community mechanics in an MMO environment, rather than endless battles. Last month, the studio showcased a launch trailer of the title which hinted at a good deal of the gameplay. Palia looks to be a medieval Zelda-like environment where users can move between towns in an open world environment while farming and collecting resources to build structures in a shared world.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/lP009fvbt8c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The company has said in marketing materials that the title is &#8220;designed to create community, friendships and a real sense of belonging.&#8221; In a statement, a16z partner Jonathan Lai called the upcoming title, &#8220;warm and dynamic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There are still quite a bit of unanswered questions about the title, which is currently taking sign-ups on its website to be alerted to pre-alpha access.

The browser gets some key updates with every major macOS refresh, but this is one of the largest in recent memory. There was some concern following the keynote that the updates would only introduce confusion for many users. And certainly it\u2019s true that people hate disruptions to their workflow \u2014 this is likely one of a handful of reasons I\u2019ve never seriously concerned switching to Safari as a default every day browser. Change is hard, friends. Of course, change is also a necessary part of evolving.

Your mileage will vary, of course, but the idea at the heart of it is tying the field to the individual tabs, rather than having it more of a constant presence. There&#8217;s more control of of the tabs, as well, in the form of Tab Groups, which allow you to essentially bookmark a bunch of sites together, so you can group them into things like Home and Work (assuming those ever become separate things again).<\/p>\n<p>If you know anything about how Apple makes software, it shouldn&#8217;t come as any surprise that those groups get synced across devices via your Safari account. This is the kind of feature that could break either way for folks &#8212; it either means getting more organized or just creating a whole bunch of new groups of infinite tabs.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2172762\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2172762\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2172762\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg 2050w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=1536,899 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1199 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2172762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The additions to FaceTime are a pretty welcome pandemic no-brainer.

The feature makes it possible to share wireless keyboards and mic\/trackpads across compatible Macs and iPads. It&#8217;s not exactly a replacement for Sidecar, nor does it specifically build on that technology. Where Sidecar effectively turns an iPad into a second screen, Universal Control maintains the standard iPad functionality, albeit with a cursor that moves across devices. Both seem compelling for creatives and frequent travelers, but it will be interesting to see if one effectively cannibalizes the other.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of cross-device functionality, AirPlay to Mac is one of those features where you wonder why it took so long. Here you can share content from an iPhone or other Apple device directly on your big screen Mac. The computer can also serve as an Airplay speaker, casting music from that device onto the system.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2172785\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2172785\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2172785\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.52.30-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"688\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.52.30-PM.png 1510w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.52.30-PM.png?resize=150,101 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.52.30-PM.png?resize=300,201 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.52.30-PM.png?resize=768,516 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.52.30-PM.png?resize=680,457 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.52.30-PM.png?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2172785\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the arrival of the Mac version of Shortcuts marks the beginning of the end for Automater.

online shopping platform considered the Amazon of its country \u2014 floats on the Nasdaq today, for a valuation likely to exceed $3.9 billion on current projections, especially with shares being marked up to $14 apiece (up from the previously predicted $12 pricing). But this isn\u2019t the end of the journey for this breakout Turkish tech and e-commerce company, for long-time founder and chairwoman <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hanzade_Do%C4%9Fan_Boyner\">Hanzade Do\u011fan Boyner<\/a> \u2014 who started the business in 1998 no less and still has overall control of the company \u2014 considers this closer to a growth round of funding, enabling her ambitious plans to mine Turkey\u2019s fast-developing market even further, as well as expand into Central and Eastern Europe. Do\u011fan Boyner, a scion of the powerful Do\u011fan family in Turkey, continues to hold three-quarters of the voting power in the company, according to the prospectus filed to the SEC.<\/p>\n<p>Hepsiburada\u2019s IPO comes after it more than doubled its revenue during the pandemic, as Turkey\u2019s largely offline population was forced to switch to online shopping.<\/p>\n<p>Hepsiburada (which translates as \u201ceverything is here\u201d) is also making history as the first-ever Turkish NASDAQ IPO.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>With a massive logistics platform spread across Turkey, the company now offers two-hour deliveries, with around 43 million products available on the platform, available from a more Chinese-like superapp that can offer everything from groceries to flights, to payment services, via is &#8220;Alipay-like&#8221; service called Hepsipay. In Turkey, many people prefer to buy things in installments, a service Hepsiburada has pre-built into its platform.<\/p>\n<p>Turkish people have also enjoyed its frictionless returns, where goods can be returned for free, involving a super-efficient logistics network.<\/p>\n<p>After growing at about 50% year on year for the last five years, the company says it doubled in size last year, taking advantage of the exponential growth in Turkey\u2019s e-commerce penetration into its 82-million-strong population.<\/p>\n<p>The IPO comes after a mere $100 million was invested in the platform over the last 20 years, and a profit-making period until 2018 when Do\u011fan Boyner started investing more in the platform, prior to this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: What brought you to this moment in time in terms of the IPO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do\u011fan Boyner: Almost 20 years ago I started with e-commerce and from day one we built it with new features, new services, and today we manage a fully integrated ecosystem, from last-mile delivery to payment to groceries. Hepsiburada is the superapp that makes our customer&#8217;s lives easier. They can get their groceries or their toys for next-day delivery or flight tickets. Why are we listing now? Because the Turkish e-commerce market is at 10% penetration, and we believe that its penetration will double by 2025. It&#8217;s an inflection point. It&#8217;s a large market, and as Hepsiburada we are a pioneering platform reaching maturity toward becoming a public company. With the funds raised through the IPO, we will accelerate our growth and continue to execute our vision.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you satisfied with the $3.9 billion valuation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s valuation is not very important for me. It\u2019s not where you start, it&#8217;s where you go. I\u2019m not selling any shares, and this is primarily for growth funding. This is just the beginning. You know, the market is still low penetration, and we have an exciting journey ahead of us. I want the stock to perform well for my investors, but what the value is today is irrelevant for me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re going to use some of this funding to add on new products onto the platform like booking flights or money transfers and other kinds of new products, what are some of the other kinds of expansion plans you have?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One is to continue building our infrastructure, such as frictionless returns, which gives such peace of mind to our consumers. The second is Hepsi Express. It&#8217;s still only at 4% penetration. This will change the consumer\u2019s grocery shopping habit because we have such a strong model where we partner with a lot of national chains, regional chains, mom-and-pop shops, so we turn those stores into our &#8220;dark stores.&#8221; Plus we sometimes do our own picking from the stores or sometimes the retailer does the picking. So the customer offering is very strong. You can get something in half an hour, or you can schedule it for next day, whenever you want. You can do the weekly shopping, or just get something for that night. Express is an area that we will scale. Payment is another focus. We are the only platform with a payments license. Soon it will be an open wallet and our fintech capabilities will increase post IPO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you following a sort of Alibaba\/Alipay strategy?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We will leverage our current customers and marketplace, and we will turn them into our wallet customers. Superapps don\u2019t really exist in Europe or the U.S. So it\u2019s our vision to digitalize commerce. We are in our customer&#8217;s pocket. We want to make life easier for them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you shift operations during the pandemic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We almost became a lifeline, not just for consumers but for our merchants as well. So we rose to the occasion to not only scale operationally. We had to onboard 1,000s of drivers and employees, very, very fast, but we also had to secure the well-being of our employees. While all of us were isolating we had to ask our employees to work, which, I think we&#8217;ve done a very, very good job of, in terms of providing PPE, and providing health coverage. It was a chance to live up to our values. Our consumers experimented with us as new consumers, and they&#8217;re happy with the service so they will stay with us and our merchants appreciated us as well, because in a time when their shops were closed, they could generate revenues through us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been a big advocate of women in your company and also in your country, you&#8217;ve created many programs for women and girls and engaged in a great deal of advocacy. Where do you feel you are on that journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Half our workforce is female, 33% of our management is female \u2014 which should be 50%! Our woman entrepreneur program has been very impactful. We tell women entrepreneurs to come, we will teach you e-commerce, we will onboard your products, we will give you free shipping, we will prioritize your products or listing pages, we will give you real estate on our home page. Some 19,000 women have benefitted from this. Women have sent me their inspiring stories. They start small and hire two people, and then they create their own brands. Having said that, when I look at where we are in terms of gender equality globally, the needle doesn&#8217;t move much. You look at the number of CEOs in the FTSE 500, the number doesn&#8217;t change. So, I will keep doing whatever I can, because every &#8220;small drop&#8221; counts. And hopefully, it will. I also think there should be a new conversation, a global conversation about gender equality in general. The 19,000 women who benefited from our program became economically more empowered. They gained skills and tools and confidence to trade on a platform like Hepsiburada, which is very meaningful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you concerned that perhaps your success may attract the attention of government regulation in Turkey, in the future?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are considered a national champion. Turkey has different dynamics. I think it&#8217;s an inspiration that national champions can come out and be successful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been very hugely successful, you&#8217;re a big advocate for women in your country, do you have any political aspirations?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"SCPQvl6K2x\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/28\/summer-sale-save-10-on-extra-crunch-membership\/\">Summer Sale: Save 10% on Extra Crunch membership<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Summer Sale: Save 10% on Extra Crunch membership&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/28\/summer-sale-save-10-on-extra-crunch-membership\/embed\/#?secret=SCPQvl6K2x\" data-secret=\"SCPQvl6K2x\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hepsiburada \u2014 Turkey&#8217;s giant online shopping platform considered the Amazon of its country \u2014 floats on the Nasdaq today, for a valuation likely to exceed $3.9 billion on current projections, especially with shares being marked up to $14 apiece (up from the previously predicted $12 pricing).

Creating a new market is a high-risk scenario lined with pitfalls disguised as opportunities, but the rewards are potentially immense.<\/p>\n<p>The first type of company never has to leave India. You can start your company there, hire local talent and begin selling your high-quality remote services to midmarket businesses across the globe.

whether you&#8217;re an Instagram influencer or a freelance graphic designer. But traditional banks haven&#8217;t caught up.<\/p>\n<p>Take Alexandra Botez for example. The Stanford graduate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/02\/19\/25-year-old-earns-6-figures-playing-chess-on-twitch.html\">earns six figures<\/a> playing chess on Twitch, where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/botezlive\">she has 877,000 followers<\/a>. But when she tried to apply for a business credit card, she was rejected twice. Meanwhile, when the creator behind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCHsRtomD4twRf5WVHHk-cMw\">TierZoo<\/a>, a YouTube channel with 2.7 million subscribers, tried to rent an apartment, he was rejected because his landlord didn&#8217;t see his business as legitimate.<\/p>\n<p>Eric Wei noticed this disconnect while he was a product manager at Instagram, where he helped build Instagram Live. With co-founder Will Kim, a previous investor with seed fund Lucky Capital, Wei launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trykarat.com\/\">Karat Financial<\/a>, a better banking system for digital creators. Today, Karat Financial announced a $26 million Series A round led by Union Square Ventures with participation from GGV Capital and SignalFire.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Banks need to understand you in order to trust you, and it&#8217;s only when they trust you that they&#8217;re willing to give you credit, process your payments and hold your money,&#8221; Wei told TechCrunch. &#8220;If Alexandra Botez has 800,000 followers, and let&#8217;s say a tenth of them are paying a monthly subscription fee on Twitch, you can actually back into what these creators&#8217; income streams are and develop a better underwriting model than what the banks have today.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But Karat isn&#8217;t solving a problem exclusive to the 1% of digital creators. Even for someone like a self-employed small business owner or a gig worker, it can be challenging to find a landlord that will rent an apartment without a proof of employment letter and regular paystubs. But the creator economy remains a fast-growing sector &#8212; more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/mattklein\/2020\/09\/23\/50m-join-the-creator-economy-as-new-platforms-emerge-to-help-anyone-produce-content--money\/?sh=7ade4e813165\">two million creators<\/a> make over $100,000 per year, and according to VC firm SignalFire, <a href=\"https:\/\/signalfire.com\/blog\/creator-economy\/\">over 46.7 million people<\/a> have enough of a following to monetize their content part time.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This whole industry exploded,&#8221; said Kim. &#8220;If it&#8217;s a flash in the pan, it&#8217;s a fifteen-year-old flash.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Wei and Kim founded Karat in 2019, then earned a spot in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/04\/venture-capitalists-like-and-subscribe-to-influencers\/\">Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2020 accelerator.<\/a> By June 2020, Karat launched its first product, the Karat Black Card, a credit card for creators, and earned <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/25\/karat-black-card\/\">$4.6 million in seed funding<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> from investors like Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2171281\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2171281\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2171281\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Karat-Landing-Page_Mobile_Free_Credit_Card_Mockup_20-vup-cobrand.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Karat-Landing-Page_Mobile_Free_Credit_Card_Mockup_20-vup-cobrand.png 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Karat-Landing-Page_Mobile_Free_Credit_Card_Mockup_20-vup-cobrand.png?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Karat-Landing-Page_Mobile_Free_Credit_Card_Mockup_20-vup-cobrand.png?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Karat-Landing-Page_Mobile_Free_Credit_Card_Mockup_20-vup-cobrand.png?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Karat-Landing-Page_Mobile_Free_Credit_Card_Mockup_20-vup-cobrand.png?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Karat-Landing-Page_Mobile_Free_Credit_Card_Mockup_20-vup-cobrand.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Karat-Landing-Page_Mobile_Free_Credit_Card_Mockup_20-vup-cobrand.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Karat-Landing-Page_Mobile_Free_Credit_Card_Mockup_20-vup-cobrand.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2171281\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Karat<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our vetting process is we try to evaluate creators as the businesses they are,&#8221; Wei said. The Karat Black Card doesn&#8217;t charge interest or fees, and only turns a marginal profit off of bank interchange fees. Karat will also advance credit for sponsorship payments at no cost to the creator. So if you&#8217;re an influencer and get paid $1,000 to make a video sponsored by a clothing company, it could take months to get paid. Karat will give you that $1,000 now, so long as you pay them back once the clothing company pays you.<\/p>\n<p>Karat proved its concept with 50% growth from month to month and eight figures in transactions since launch last year. More than 30 creators have invested in Karat, including <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JaredLeto?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Jared Leto<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/3lau\/\">3LAU<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nasdaily\">Nas Daily<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@joshrichards?lang=en\">Josh Richards<\/a> &#8212; that&#8217;s all without any spending on influencer marketing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It turns out that when you do a good job for creators, they share you around with other people,&#8221; Wei said.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> Since then, their portfolio of investors has grown to include YouTube co-founder Steven Chen, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, former TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer and former Wealthfront CEO Adam Nash, among others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But Karat&#8217;s ultimate ambition isn&#8217;t to give creators a line of credit. They started out with the credit card to prove their concept, but in the long term, they hope to create a financial infrastructure for creators. That means helping them launch merchandise lines, incorporate their business, get a mortgage, take out business loans and file their taxes. Wei says that would come after the company&#8217;s Series B, opening a more lucrative income stream than collecting bank interchange fees.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We decided to roll Karat out with the same tried-and-true fintech playbook,&#8221; Wei said. &#8220;Start out with something simple before wedging and scaling into those other products. So for us, the card is just a means to an end. Our whole model is, we use the cards to develop our underwriting model and gain trust from creators, and eventually, we can build to be Square for creators.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Already, Wei and Kim are getting texts from their internet celebrity clients, asking them to be their de-facto financial advisers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just like, oh my gosh, we love you, but we&#8217;re not building those products yet,&#8221; Wei said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll do that when we hit our Series B, and yes, we&#8217;ll charge you fees, because we&#8217;re going to provide you with better service than what&#8217;s out there now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>With the newly announced Series A round, Karat plans to double its staff with new hires and begin looking toward new product development.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4xRlYBrb3a\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/17\/5-tips-for-brands-that-want-to-succeed-in-the-new-era-of-influencer-marketing\/\">5 tips for brands that want to succeed in the new era of influencer marketing<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;5 tips for brands that want to succeed in the new era of influencer marketing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/17\/5-tips-for-brands-that-want-to-succeed-in-the-new-era-of-influencer-marketing\/embed\/#?secret=4xRlYBrb3a\" data-secret=\"4xRlYBrb3a\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"e6jdzjbpxP\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/25\/karat-black-card\/\">Karat launches a credit card for online creators<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Karat launches a credit card for online creators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/25\/karat-black-card\/embed\/#?secret=e6jdzjbpxP\" data-secret=\"e6jdzjbpxP\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Yvta3LLWFv\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/04\/venture-capitalists-like-and-subscribe-to-influencers\/\">Venture capitalists \u2018like and subscribe\u2019 to influencers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Venture capitalists \u2018like and subscribe\u2019 to influencers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/04\/venture-capitalists-like-and-subscribe-to-influencers\/embed\/#?secret=Yvta3LLWFv\" data-secret=\"Yvta3LLWFv\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The creator economy is changing the way that people earn a living, whether you&#8217;re an Instagram influencer or a freelance graphic designer.

They are critically important to virtually every enterprise organization and industry worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>Given APIs&#8217; ubiquity and importance, it\u2019s understandable that all industry eyes were on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s April 5 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/opinions\/20pdf\/18-956_d18f.pdf\">ruling<\/a> in Google LLC v. Oracle America Inc., an 11-year-old case that addressed two core questions: Whether copyright protection extends to an API, and whether use of an API in the context of creating a new computer program constitutes fair use. Google lawyers had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/DocketPDF\/18\/18-956\/95912\/20190410092802431_Google%20Cert.%20Reply.pdf\">called<\/a> it &#8220;the copyright case of the decade.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I was one of 83 computer scientists \u2014 including five <a href=\"https:\/\/amturing.acm.org\/\">Turing Award<\/a> winners and four National Medal of Technology honorees \u2014 who signed a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/DocketPDF\/18\/18-956\/128391\/20200113145027664_18-956%20Google%20v%20Oracle%20Computer%20Scientists%20Merits%20Amicus%20FOR%20FILING.pdf\">Supreme Court amicus brief<\/a> stating their opposition to the assertion that APIs are copyrightable, while also supporting Google\u2019s right to fair use under the current legal definition.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tTo be clear: APIs should be free of copyright, no ifs, ands or buts.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>We explained that the freedom to reimplement and extend existing APIs has been critical to technological innovation by ensuring competitors could challenge established players and advance the state of the art. &#8220;Excluding APIs from copyright protection has been essential to the development of modern computers and the internet,&#8221; the brief said.<\/p>\n<p>The Supreme Court ruling was a mixed bag that many observers are still parsing. In a 6-2 decision, justices sided with Google and its argument that the company\u2019s copying of 11,500 lines of code from Oracle\u2019s Java in the Android operating system was fair use. Great! At the same time, though, the court appeared to be operating under the assumption that APIs are copyrightable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGiven the rapidly changing technological, economic and business-related circumstances, we believe we should not answer more than is necessary to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute,\u201d Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the majority. \u201cWe shall assume, but purely for argument\u2019s sake, that [the code] \u201cfalls within the definition of that which can be copyrighted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While it may take years to fully understand the ruling\u2019s impact, it\u2019s important to keep dissecting the issue now, as APIs only continue to become more essential as the pipes behind every internet-connected device and application.<\/p>\n<p>The legal saga began when Google used Java APIs in developing Android. Google wrote its own implementation of the Java APIs, but in order to allow developers to write their own programs for Android, Google&#8217;s implementation used the same names, organization and functionality as the Java APIs.<\/p>\n<p>Oracle sued Google in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in August 2010, seven months after it closed its acquisition of Java creator Sun Microsystems, contending that Google had infringed Oracle\u2019s copyright.<\/p>\n<p>In May 2012, Judge William Alsup ruled that APIs are not subject to copyright because that would hamper innovation. Oracle appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which reversed Judge Alsup in May 2014, finding that the Java APIs are copyrightable. However, he also sent the case back to the trial court to determine whether Google has a fair use defense.<\/p>\n<p>A new District Court trial began in May 2016 on the fair use question. A jury found that Google\u2019s implementation of the Java API was fair use. Oracle appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals in March 2018 again reversed the lower court. Google filed a petition with the Supreme Court in January 2019, receiving a hearing date in early 2020. However, lengthening the case\u2019s torturous path through the courts even further, COVID-19 forced oral arguments to be postponed to last October. Finally, on April 5, the Supreme Court settled the matter.<\/p>\n<p>Or did it?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSupreme Court Leaves as Many Questions as It Answers in Google v. Oracle,\u201d read a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.law.com\/2021\/05\/27\/supreme-court-leaves-as-many-questions-as-it-answers-in-google-v-oracle\/?slreturn=20210511103116\">headline<\/a> on <a href=\"http:\/\/law.com\">law.com<\/a>. The National Law Review <a href=\"https:\/\/www.natlawreview.com\/article\/supreme-court-answers-some-copyright-questions-leaves-others-unsettled-google-v\">said<\/a>: \u201cThe Supreme Court sidestepped the fundamental IP issue \u2014 whether or not Oracle\u2019s software code at the heart of the case is copyrightable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On one hand, I\u2019m disappointed that the court\u2019s ruling left even a hint of ambiguity about whether APIs are copyrightable. To be clear: APIs should be free of copyright, no ifs, ands or buts.<\/p>\n<p>APIs provide structure, sequence and organization for digital resources in the same way that a restaurant menu does for food. Imagine if Restaurant A, which serves burgers, fries and shakes, couldn\u2019t use the same words, as well as the ordering and organization of the words, on their menu as Restaurant B. A menu doesn\u2019t represent a novel expression; rather, it is the ingredients, processes and service that define a restaurant. Both burger places benefit from the shared concept of a menu and the shared knowledge among their consumers of what burgers, fries and shakes are. It is the execution of the menu that ultimately will set one restaurant apart from another.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, APIs are not intellectual property; they are simply operational elements that are common, reusable, remixable, and able to be put into use in as many applications by as many developers as possible.<\/p>\n<p>This pattern plays out over and over across many different sectors of our economy where APIs are being used, reused and remixed to generate new kinds of applications, integrations or entirely new companies and products or services. Immense value is generated by the free, collective, collaborative and open evolution of APIs.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, I\u2019m pleased by the part of the Supreme Court ruling that widens the definition of fair use. I think that provides the scope needed to take the industry into its API future without too much friction.<\/p>\n<p>I also believe the case will chill future attempts by other companies to engage in litigation over API copyright. In the end, the decade-long Google vs. Oracle case negatively affected Oracle\u2019s image when it comes to the fast-growing API sector, and I suspect other companies will think twice before going to court.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, companies may want to be extra cautious about licensing their APIs using the widest possible license, applying a <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/share-your-work\/public-domain\/cc0\/\">Creative Commons CC0<\/a> or CC BY to APIs built with tolls and specifications, such as Swagger, OpenAPI and AsyncAPI.<\/p>\n<p>Now that Google vs. Oracle is finally history, I feel that the API sector will remain as vibrant as ever. That\u2019s excellent news for everybody.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YvHtDaGCQy\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/17\/from-startups-to-starbucks-the-embedded-api-opportunity\/\">From startups to Starbucks: The embedded API opportunity<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;From startups to Starbucks: The embedded API opportunity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/17\/from-startups-to-starbucks-the-embedded-api-opportunity\/embed\/#?secret=YvHtDaGCQy\" data-secret=\"YvHtDaGCQy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Given APIs&#8217; ubiquity and importance, it\u2019s understandable that all eyes were on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s April 5 ruling in Google LLC v.

the interviews, published profiles and all of that fun stuff. t\u00a0 I admit that I\u2019m also partly putting that off because there\u2019s just a ton of investment news to get through in the meantime. Though I do want to note that the Pittsburgh Robotics Network held its own big event the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/robotics_ai_industry_leaders_announce_commitment_to_make_pittsburgh_the_robotics_capital_of_the_world\/prweb18041387.htm\"> same day as ours<\/a> &#8212; honestly, there&#8217;s just a ton of activity in the city this week, including visits from some national politicians.<\/p>\n<p>Per the PRN press release,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The alliance brings together leaders from top robotics companies, research institutions and universities in the Pittsburgh area, including Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Argo AI, Aurora, the University of Pittsburgh, Kaarta, RE2 Robotics, Neya Systems, Carnegie Robotics, HEBI Robotics, Near Earth Autonomy, BirdBrain Technologies, Omnicell and Advanced Construction Robotics. The Richard King Mellon Foundation commemorated this membership milestone with a grant of $125,000 to support the continued growth of the PRN.<\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>I hinted the other week that there would be a uptick in funding announcements, and we\u2019ve certainly seen that come to fruition. Once upon a time, we used to have this thing called the summer doldrums. Maybe it\u2019s the pandemic, but formerly slow season no longer really applies here. VCs are still super bullish on robotics and keep pumping money in across the category.<\/p>\n<p>Before we get started, however, a bit of a somber note to say goodbye to Pepper \u2013 for now, at least. A rep for SoftBank Robotics confirmed with TechCrunch that the company will be hitting pause on the production of affable robotic greeter.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28\/\"> Reuters was first to report<\/a> a \u201cretrenchment\u201d in SoftBank\u2019s robotics, including the elimination of 330 roles in France. The company noted in a press release, &#8220;Since 2012 SoftBank Robotics Group, a subsidiary of SoftBank, has invested in Humanoid Robotics and intends to keep Pepper &amp; NAO robots business moving forward.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1077715\" style=\"width: 628px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1077715\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1077715\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/nao-robot.jpg\" alt=\"NAO Robot\" width=\"618\" height=\"620\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/nao-robot.jpg 618w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/nao-robot.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/nao-robot.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/nao-robot.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/nao-robot.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/nao-robot.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/nao-robot.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/nao-robot.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1077715\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Aldebaran Robotics under a <a href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/3.0\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CC-BY-3.0 license<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As a refresher, the investment giant\u2019s 2021 acquisition of French robotics startup Aldebaran Robotics gave rise to both SoftBank Robotics and Pepper. The latter evolved from Nao, a research robot that had pretty wide scale adoption in that world. To this day, you\u2019ll still see the \u2018bot at universities and research institutes all over.<\/p>\n<p>Pepper was an attempt to bring some of that underlying technology to a broader commercial audience. The robot was made life-size and designed to hold a tablet and greet people. And, honestly, that was kind of it. Technology in search of a problem, as the saying goes \u2013 sophisticated robotics that can greet you at an Applebee\u2019s or offer you some information at the airport.<\/p>\n<p>Precisely why Pepper didn\u2019t work out \u2013 and how much issues from the past year played into that \u2013 is something better saved for a deeper dive, but I\u2019ve always been skeptical of how useful the robot really was. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a compelling argument that this was something that required advanced robotics. Of course, a far more compelling argument can be made that specializing in building research robotics is, at best, a loss leader.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2170829\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2170829\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2170829\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png 6000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Versius-in-operating-theatre-with-surgical-team.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2170829\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> CMR Surgical<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>That said, there\u2019s still plenty to get excited about on the robotics investment front.

Their patented deep technology is cleaner, faster and 4x more profitable than current lithium-ion battery recycling and the only technology to fully rejuvenate the battery cathode. For two decades lithium-ion batteries have been our preferred source of portable energy, but the sad reality is that with a lifespan of only 1 \u2013 3 years, 95% end up as dangerous landfill. The precious metals used to manufacture them are often mined in socially and environmentally damaging ways. They are not being recycled, because it is simply not economical to do so with current technology. Green Li-ion changes this by removing inefficient processes and improving the purity of the output, making lithium-ion battery rejuvenation and reuse the new reality. Green Li-ion\u2019s multi-cathode technology and control unit GLMC-1 enhances current lithium-ion battery recycling lines to produce 99.9% pure cathodes. This in turn delivers 4x profits for e-recyclers and lithium-ion battery recyclers, while halving production time. It\u2019s also currently the only technology in the world that can handle all major lithium-ion batteries at one time; which means no sorting.
