## Nodebox Library folder ##



## Things that are new ##

`twyg` - The twyg library needs at least NodeBox 1.9.23.



The contents of this repo go into the ```~/Library/Application Support/Nodebox/``` folder. As of 2017-05-20 and NodeBox v1.9.17+ the library folder can be anywhere.

These are modules that could be made to work with my [Nodebox fork](https://github.com/karstenw/nodebox-pyobjc).

The module ```ants``` runs.

The module ```beziereditor``` runs.

The module ```boids``` runs.

The module ```colors``` has been patched for zipfile support. The [patch](https://github.com/shoebot/shoebot/commit/b2b9c43b28acb9312ca2a0557cc8728fc49a47bb) came from the [shoebot](https://github.com/shoebot/shoebot) project. You'll need at least Nodebox version 1.9.17.

The module ```coreimage``` runs mostly.

The module ```cornu``` runs.

The module ```database``` runs but should not be used. Use linguistics.pattern.db

The module ```en``` has been removed. Use linguistics and adapt your scripts.

The module ```graph``` runs mostly.

The module ```grid``` runs.

The module ```Ã¬sight``` has been rewritten to use the newer [imagesnap](http://iharder.net/imagesnap) tool which makes it possible to take sequences of images very quickly.

The module ```lsys```has been written from scratch. Why? Because lindemayer systems are fun. Included are a lot of demos from "Algorithmic Beauty of Plants" and "Lindenmayer Systems, Fractals, and Plants".

The module ```lsystem``` runs.

The module ```noise``` has been adapted and the _noise.so file has been compiled for x86\_64

The module ```perception``` has been removed; may come back.

The module ```quicktime``` runs on Intel. Can't run on newer Macs with M-*

The module ```supershape``` has been adapted and the cSuperformula.so file has been compiled for x86_64
