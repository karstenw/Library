## Nodebox Library folder ##

The contents of this repo go into the ```~/Library/Application Support/Nodebox/``` folder.

These modules could be made to work with my [Nodebox fork](https://github.com/karstenw/nodebox-pyobjc).

The module ``Ã¬sight```has been rewritten to use the newer [imagesnap](http://iharder.net/imagesnap) tool.
