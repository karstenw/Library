## Nodebox Library folder ##

## Things that are new ##

`twyg` - The twyg library needs at least NodeBox 1.9.23.



The contents of this repo go into the ```~/Library/Application Support/Nodebox/``` folder. As of 2017-05-20 and NodeBox v1.9.17+ the library folder can be anywhere.

These are modules that could be made to work with my [Nodebox fork](https://github.com/karstenw/nodebox-pyobjc).

The module ```ants``` runs unchanged.
