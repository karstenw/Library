Shadow, religion, fantasy, magic, royalty, dignity. Over the millennia, purple has been associated with royalty in Western civilizations, due to the difficulty and expense involved in producing purple dye, which was made from a particular species of mollusk shell. Even today, when purple can be produced just as inexpensively as any other color, the use of purple is still considered to represent elegance and sophistication. Purple is indicative of devotion, healing abilities, loving, kindness, and compassion.  It is also the color of royalty, high rank, and dignity.
