Warmth, autumn, energy, tension, cheer, life. Orange is considered a warm color, perhaps because it has evoked the feeling of fire, all the way back to mankindâ€™s earliest beginnings. Painting walls a subtle orange, leaning toward a warm brown, stimulates the appetite and can reduce tension. However, as the orange color becomes brighter, it begins to take on a high energy feel and can lead to anxiety. Orange denotes friendliness, courtesy, lively, sociability, and an out-going nature.
