Dreaming that you are applying your brakes means that you should slow down in your business and/or personal affairs. You have been living on the fast lane and you need to take it easy.  Dreaming that your brakes failed, forewarns that you lack any sort of stability in your life. Your life is out of control. Any agreements that you entertain or engage yourself into will prove risky.
