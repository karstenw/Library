Dreaming that something is bright, represents divinity, a higher consciousness, and spirituality. You need to honor an admirable person or situation.   The dream may also be a metaphor for intellect and someone who is smart.  If the brightness is blinding, then it suggests that you are not paying attention to some new insights.
