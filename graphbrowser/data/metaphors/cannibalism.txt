Seeing cannibalism in your dream, symbolizes a destructive and forbidden desire or obsession. In a literal sense, cannibals consume people's lives, along with their energy. This dream may then denote an aspect of your life (career, relationship, children...) which is consistently draining your enthusiasm and vitality.  Dreaming that you are a victim of cannibalism means that you feel that you are being "eating alive" by work, a relationship. or a situation in your waking life.
