Seeing a fire damper in your dream indicates the warmth of friends. You have a lot of love to offer. Alternatively, it may represent your pent up frustrations and anger. You are holding in your negative emotions. If the damper is broken, then it indicates a situation or relationship that has made you cold and bitter.
