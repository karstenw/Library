Seeing a museum in your dream indicates that your non-traditional path to success will make you unique and stand out from the rest. Alternatively, the museum may represent a history of yourself and your past. There are many things you can learn from your past and your family's past.  Consider what you have gained from these experiences and apply them to your current circumstances.  Dreaming that you are in a museum,  gives you the opportunity for you to review and reflect on the things you value in life.
