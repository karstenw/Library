Dreaming that you are hungry means a feeling of unfulfilment in some area of your life. You may be starving for recognition, power, sex, wealth, or fame. You are longing to achieve something that you have desired for awhile. Or this dream may simply be that you are really feeling hungry and it is being manifested in your dream.
