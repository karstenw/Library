Seeing a girl in your dream, represents your playful, innocent, and childlike nature. Perhaps you have been behaving prematurely.  Dreaming about a girl that you just met, represents your anxieties and thoughts of whether you had made a good impression on her and what she thought of you. If she told you that she disliked you in the dream, then it may be an excuse for you to dismiss her and not pursue a relationship that is beyond friendship.  For a man to dream that he is a girl means that he aspires to be an actor and play female parts.
