Dreaming that you or someone else is hanging up wallpaper means that you are putting up a barrier or some sort of shield between yourself and others. It also suggest that you are covering something up - a secret of sorts. Alternatively, it may mean something that needs beautifying.  Dreaming that you are peeling or stripping off wallpaper indicates that you are beginning to let your guard down or breaking down a barrier that you have kept between you and others. It also indicates that you are revealing aspects of yourself that have been kept well hidden.  The color and pattern of the wallpaper will offer clues as what kind of barrier, secret, or feeling is being represented by the wallpaper.
