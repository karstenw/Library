Dreaming that you slip on something means that you are forcing yourself to do things that you do not really want to do.  Dreaming that you are wearing only a slip, suggests that you are trying not to be like everyone else and finding your own way. You have the courage to live by your own beliefs. Alternatively, it indicates that you are revealing a part of yourself that was once unknown.
