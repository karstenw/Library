Seeing a helicopter in your dream, represents your ambition and achievements. You are in full pursuit of your goals.  Dreaming that you are in a helicopter indicates that you are living beyond your means.  You need to slow down and don't try to please everyone. Alternatively, you may be experiencing a higher level of consciousness, new-found freedom and greater awareness.
