Dreaming that you are carving a piece of wood, symbolizes spiritual and creative energy. Metaphorically, you are transforming unconscious energy into conscious awareness. Consider whether the carving is purely ornamental or utilitarian.  Dreaming that you are carving a cooked animal indicates that you are trying to rid yourself of certain feelings. You may be distancing yourself from your emotions and analyzing them from an objective standpoint. Alternatively, some person or situation is violating an aspect of your life.
