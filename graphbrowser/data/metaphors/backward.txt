Dreaming that you are walking or moving backward means that what you are doing may be counter-productive. What you are seeking in life appears to be moving away from you. Thus you may be feeling a sense of failure or believe that you are unable to achieve your goals and aspirations. On the other hand, moving backward in your dream may symbolize that you should back off or retreat in a situation you may be facing in your waking life.
