Dreaming that you are at the carnival, represents falsehoods and deception. If you observe freakish sights, then it means that there is a lack of harmony in your domestic life.  Much sorrow will arise in what were thought to be pleasant times.  Dreaming that you are on a carnival ride, suggests that you are going in circles. It may also symbolize cheap thrills.  Dreaming that you run away with the carnival means that you will be involved in or closely connected to the entertainment field.
