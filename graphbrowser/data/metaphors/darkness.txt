Dreaming that darkness comes upon you means failure in work you may attempt.  Darkness is synonymous with ignorance, the unconscious, evil, death, and fear of the unknown. If the sun breaks through the darkness, then you will overcome your failures. If you feel safe in the dark, then it suggests that you like not knowing about certain things. As some might say, ignorance is bliss.  Dreaming that you cannot find someone in the darkness means that you need to keep your temper in check.  You have the tendency to let your emotions get out of control and lose your temper.  Dreaming that you are lost in the darkness indicates feelings of desperation, depression, or insecurity.  Dreaming that you are groping around in the darkness indicates that you have insufficient information to make a clear decision. Do your research and do not rush into making choices.
