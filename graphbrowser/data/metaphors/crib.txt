Seeing a crib in your dream, suggests that you are harvesting or  "babying" a new idea, creation or project.  Alternatively, it may refer to your nurturing, protective, and caring nature. A more literal interpretation of this symbol, suggests that you may be yearning for a baby or that you are expecting a baby.
