Dreaming that you are playing soccer, suggests that you are suppressing your sexuality and/or aggression and expressing it in a more socially acceptable manner. From a Freudian perspective, sports, in general, serve as a disguise for attitudes about sex as a aggressive act.  Hence soccer can be seen as a pun for "sock her". Alternatively, the game of soccer may refer to how you function and run your life when confronted with challenges. It is symbolic of your competency, integrity, strengths and weaknesses.
