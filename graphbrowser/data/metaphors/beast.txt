Dreaming of a beast means foolishness and ignorance.  Dreaming of faceless beasts indicates a situation you are refusing to see or confront, but are aware of it in some passive way. This dream also suggests that something in your life is bringing up feelings of fear and insecurities.  According to the bible, a beast symbolizes men in honor without understanding. (Psa: 73:22)
