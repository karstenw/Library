Seeing a clear, well-stocked fishpond, foretells of profitable enterprises and great pleasures.  Seeing a muddy fishpond in your dream indicates illness.  Seeing an empty fishpond means that nearby enemies are lurking and on the prowl.  Dreaming that you fall into a clear pond means good fortune and reciprocal love.
