Seeing your home in your dream means security, basic needs, and values. You may feel at home at your new job or you finally feel settled and comfortable in a new environment.  In particular, to see your childhood home or a home that you no longer live in, suggests your own desires for building a family. It also reflects aspects of yourself that were prominent or developed during the time you lived in that home. You may experience some feelings or unfinished expression of emotions that are now being  triggered by a waking situation.  Dreaming that you cannot find your way home indicates that you have lost faith and belief in yourself. It may also signify a major transition in your life.
