Seeing or hearing a horn in your dream means your need to pay attention to your inner voices and intuition. Alternatively, you may be bragging and "blowing your own horn".  Seeing the horns of an animal in your dream, represents conflict and confrontation.  You are at odds with someone. It may also indicate that you have been hardened.
