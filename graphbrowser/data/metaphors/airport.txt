When you dream of an airport, the meaning of such dream may vary according to whether it is an empty or busy airport. A busy airport is an indication of ambitious new beginnings. Som ideas may have been maturing in your mind, and now it is time for you to put them to use. New relationships, new dimensions, different horizons, maybe that trip you were dreaming of.  Dreaming of an empty airport might indicate some delays in your plans. It might be that you will have to change your travel plans, or you might see some old project you have beenworking on, delayed or postponed.
