Seeing a smoke stack in your dream, suggests that there is something rising out of your unconscious and into your awareness. It also indicates that there is a situation that requires your immediate attention before it gets out of hand. Alternatively, it symbolizes industry and hard work.  A smoke stack can be seen as a phallic symbol and may refer to sexual release.
