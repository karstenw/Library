Seeing a vegetable or fruit garden in your dream indicates that your hard work and diligence will pay off in the end.  It is also symbolic of stability and inner growth.  Seeing a flower garden in your dream, represents tranquility, comfort, love and domestic bliss. You need to be nurturing.  Seeing sparse, weed-infested garden, suggests that you have neglected your spiritual needs. You are not on top of things.
