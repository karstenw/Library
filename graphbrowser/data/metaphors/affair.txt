If you dream that your spouse is cheating on you but you have no reason to be suspicious, then you are advised to investigate your own insecurities first. You may be feeling depressed, unattractive, or ineffective, and may be wondering why your spouse sticks around.  Please note that dreaming of a husband's infidelity is common and normal during pregnancy and after childbirth, when a new mother may not be feeling sexually adequate. The dreams reflect concerns that a partner will look outside the relationship for fulfillment.  If you dream that you are cheating, then perhaps it is a feeling of being sexually unsatisfied, or unappreciated. Dreams of flirting and affairs can reflect needs for attention that are not being met at home. Is your partner working overtime? To make this dream go away, tell your lover what you really need.
