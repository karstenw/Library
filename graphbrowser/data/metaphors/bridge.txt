Dreaming that you are crossing a bridge means an important decision or a critical junction in your life. This decision will prove to be a positive change with prosperity and wealth in the horizon. Bridges represent a transitional period in your life where you will be moving on to a new stage.  Dreaming of a run-down bridge indicates that you should not contemplate any major changes in your life at this time.  Dreaming of a bridge collapse indicates that you have let a great opportunity pass you by.
