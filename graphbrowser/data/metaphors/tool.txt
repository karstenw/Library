Seeing or using tools in your dream, represents your self-expression, skills and abilities. You are using the resources that are available to you. Perhaps you need to create and move toward a different direction. Alternatively, it suggests that a situation or relationship is in need of some damage control or attention. According to the Freudian school of thought, tools are symbols of the penis and thus tools being used are symbolic of intercourse.
