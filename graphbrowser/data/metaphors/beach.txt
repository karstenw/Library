The sand is symbolic of the rational and mental processes while the water means the irrational, unsteady, and emotional aspects of yourself. It is a place of transition between the physical/material and the spiritual.

Consider the state of the ocean, whether it is calm, pleasant, forbidding, etc.  Dreaming that you are looking toward the beach, suggests that you are returning to what is familiar to you.
