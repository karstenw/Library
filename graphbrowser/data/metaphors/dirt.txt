Seeing freshly stirred dirt in your dream, symbolizes thriftiness and frugalness. Dirt is also representative of situations where you have been less than honorable and may have acted in a devious manner.  Dreaming that someone throws dirt at you indicates that enemies will try to attack your character and harm your reputation.  Dreaming that your clothes are soiled with dirt means of a contagious disease that you have been stricken with.
