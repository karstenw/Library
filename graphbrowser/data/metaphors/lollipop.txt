Seeing or lick a lollipop in your dream indicates surprises, new experiences and adventures. It also represents indulgence, sensuality and the pleasant aspects of life. Alternatively, the lollipop may be a pun for "sucker" and thus suggests that you need to proceed with caution in some relationship or situation.
