Seeing a picture in your dream, symbolizes a mental imprint that remains persistent in your mind.  There may be permanence in your actions. Also consider the pun on "picture this" or "seeing the big picture" in a situation.  Dreaming that you are taking a picture, suggests that you need to get a good understanding and gain more information on some issue. You need to focus more attention to some situation or relationship. Perhaps you feel that you need to recapture some past moments in a relationship.  Seeing a black and white picture in your dream indicates that you need to consider opposing views/values. Alternatively, it may denote you need to add more color and pizazz to you life.  Seeing a blurry picture in your dream, suggests that your memory of the depicted event, incident, or people, is fading. Perhaps you need to let go of the past and stop holding on to what was and concentrate on what is. On the other hand, you are attempting to disguise a situation and refusing to see it as it really is.  You need to learn acceptance.
