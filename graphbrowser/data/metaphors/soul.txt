Dreaming that you have a lack of soul or no soul, suggests that you are feeling spiritually lost. You need to find yourself and what will make you feel whole as a person.  Dreaming that your soul is leaving your body, represents your feelings of self-guilt. You may have compromised your own beliefs and values. Perhaps you are feeling numb or out of touch with those around you. You need to change some vital part of your waking life in order to feel fully alive and whole again.
