Seeing your husband in your dream means your relationship with your husband and the unconscious feelings you have towards him.  Dreaming that you have a husband (but you do not in your waking life), symbolizes some sort of partnership and/or commitment. Often, it is also representative of the qualities of your father in which you projected onto this figure or the masculine side of your own personality.
