Seeing a raft in your dream indicates that you have not built a firm foundation for yourself. There is still much work ahead.  Dreaming that you are floating on a raft, suggests that you are drifting through life, not knowing where you are headed. You are confused about your purpose and direction in life.  Dreaming that you are white water rafting means that after going through some turbulent times, your sadness and pain will slowly disappear.
