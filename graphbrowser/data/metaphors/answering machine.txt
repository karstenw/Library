Dreaming of an answering machine is an indication that you might be ingoring an important message that must get to you in a way or another. It can be a conscious choice you have made but it also can stem from difficulties you are having understanding a situation, a concept or recent changes. In all cases, maybe you should try to work on your listening and communication skills.
