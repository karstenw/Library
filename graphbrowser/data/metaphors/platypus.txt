Seeing a platypus in your dream, suggests your tendency to wallow and dwell on your emotions.  It may also suggest that your repressed thoughts and unconscious material are slowly coming to the surface and making their presence known. Alternatively, it is indicative of shyness and reservation, especially in social situations.
