Seeing a clock in your dream means the importance of time or that time is running out. You may be feeling some anxiety of not being on top of things. Your mind may be preoccupied with a deadline that you have to meet or some other time-sensitive issue. It is time for you to tread on and speed up your actions. Alternatively, clocks are representative of death, especially if the clock has stopped. This is a common theme for the terminally ill or the dying.  A clock seen in your dream may also symbolize the ticking of the human heart and thus is indicative of the emotional side of your life.
