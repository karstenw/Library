Dreaming that you injured or hurt your foot means a lack of progress, freedom, and independence. Alternatively, the dream may suggests that you have taken a step in the wrong direction. In particular, to dream that your foot gets cut by glass, then it indicates passivity.  You are hesitant or reluctant in taking the first step toward a goal or decision.
