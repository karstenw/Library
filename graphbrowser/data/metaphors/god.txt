Seeing God in your dream means your spirituality and expression of your feelings about divinity. God also symbolizes an untouchable, unreachable, and unattainable notion of perfection. Thus such a dream may highlight your struggles and attempts with trying to be perfect.  Dreaming that you are worshipping God means repentance of your actions and errors.  Dreaming that God speaks to you means feelings of guilt, eternal punishment, and damnation.  Dreaming that you are a god, implies your own special talents which you have not yet recognized or have not fully developed. Alternatively, it suggests your feelings of superiority over others.
