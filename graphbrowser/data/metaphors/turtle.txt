Seeing turtles in your dream, suggests that you will make slow but steady progress. You need to slow down and pace yourself. Alternatively, it indicates that you are sheltering yourself from the realities of life.  Dreaming that you are being chased by a turtle indicates that you are hiding behind a facade instead of confronting the things that are bothering you.
