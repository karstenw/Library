Seeing a cottage in your dream, represents comfort, peace and serenity. You prefer a life of simplicity. The cottage may represent an altered sense of reality and thus may be a means of escaping the responsibilities and problems that may be associated with your home.  You need to approach life's difficulties one at a time.
