Dreaming that you are shrinking, suggests that you lack self-confidence and self-esteem. You may also feel embarrassed or unimportant in some situation.  Perhaps you feel that you have been overlooked by others.  Alternatively, the dream may refer to a time were you were young and small and thus symbolic of your childhood.  Seeing others shrink in your dream indicates their insignificance. This may also be a pun on a psychologist and your need to consult one.  Seeing objects shrinking in your dream indicates that they are not as important as they once were.
