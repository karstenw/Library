Seeing a lock in your dream means your inability to get what you want or being kept out. Perhaps an aspect of yourself is locked up inside and needs to be expressed.  Dreaming that a lock is accidentally shut around your wrist, suggests that you are debating on whether to be more open about your feelings or keep them to yourself. You feel that you are taking a major risk in letting your feelings known.
