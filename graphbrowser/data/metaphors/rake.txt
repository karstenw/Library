Dreaming that you are using a rake means that work will never be accomplished unless you do it yourself.  Seeing others raking indicates that you will be happy on the well-being and livelihood of others.  Seeing a broken rake in your dream means that some illness or accident will interrupt your plans, resulting in its failure.
