Seeing or dreaming that you are in a hot air balloon, suggests that it is time to overcome your depression. The dream may be a metaphor indicating that you are losing your ground or your foothold on some situation/problem. Alternatively, it represents the process of  individuation and your quest to fulfill some spiritual needs. You feel the need to be elevated in someone's eyes.
