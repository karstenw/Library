Seeing your coworkers in your dream, highlights aspects of your waking relationship with them, including difficulties/support. It means your ambition, struggles and competitive nature.  If the coworkers in your dream are not your actual coworkers, then they may pertain to some psychological business that you need to work on.  Dreaming that you are training someone to take your place, suggests that you are moving on with respect to some task or inner development. You are leaving behind old attitudes and are looking toward the future.
