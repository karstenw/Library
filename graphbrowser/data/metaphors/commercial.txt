Dreaming that you are watching TV commercials means your tendency to jump from one thing to another without completing your initial responsibilities and tasks. You have a tendency to emotionally distance yourself and remain objective about the situations you are faced with.  If the commercials quickly jump from one to another, then is symbolizes your flightiness.
