Dreaming of an army can have two opposite meanings: if you are part of an army, you are feeling strong, protected and superior. But if you are seeing a foreign army and you do not join it, it means that you feel surrounded by hostile presence and you can't measure up to it. You need to have more trust in yourself and in your resources.
