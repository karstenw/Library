Dreaming of ambulances should draw your attention to possible health problems, or at least the fear of having health complications. You may also be more careful in your conduct in order not to cause harm to yourself or those around you. When you dream of an ambulance transporting wounded people, it might reflect some emotional wounds you have been hiding deep inside of you, that you are now projecting onto others. If you know the wounded, it might indicate that they might be disturbing you in some manner and that you might want to distance yourself from them until you find out the source of your discomfort.
