Seeing a loon in your dream, suggests that you have the ability to dig deep and bring up unconscious wisdom. You are looking within yourself for answers. It is time for self-exploration, self-reflection and introspection. You need to get tot he bottom of some situation. The dream may also be a metaphor for someone who is "loony" or crazy.
