Seeing a chimney in your dream, represents warmth, tradition, and family values.  Alternatively, a chimney is symbolic of a phallic symbol. Thus, to see the chimney collapse implies impotence.  Dreaming that you are sweeping the chimney indicates your need to vent off your frustrations and get things out in the open. You need to release all that negativity and/or guilt that you are holding in.
