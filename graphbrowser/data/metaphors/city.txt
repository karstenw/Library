Seeing a city in your dream means a sense of community and your social environment. Dreaming that you are in a deserted city or that you feel alienated from the activity of the city, then it suggests that you feel rejected  by those around you.  Seeing a city in ruins means that you are neglecting your social relationships and allowing them to deteriorate.
