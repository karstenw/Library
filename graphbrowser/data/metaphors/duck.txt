Seeing ducks in your dream, either represents spiritual freedom (if flying) or it represents the unconscious (if swimming).  Ducks are rather multi-talented animals that can walk, swim and fly and thus may represent your flexibility and in blending into various situations. Alternatively, the dream may also indicate that you are setting yourself up or being set up for the kill as associated by the phrase "sitting duck". Also, the duck may be a pun on "ducking" some issue or situation, instead of confronting it head-on.  Seeing a white duck in your dream means falsehood and deceit.
