Dreaming that you are in a mental institution indicates a need for rest and reset your mind. You need to not be afraid to ask for help/assistance when you need it.  Dreaming that you are outside a mental institution, suggests that you are feeling ostracized or shunned. You may be close to a mental breakdown. Or you are feeling left out, excluded, and ignored.
