Dreaming of anger may be the only way for you to express your frustrations and negative feelings. It is very safe way for your mind to cope with stressful, unpleasant situations.  It might also be the rehearsal of some real anger you are experiencing in your life, and dreaming about it may reinforce the feeling or may show you that there are other ways to deal with the problem.
