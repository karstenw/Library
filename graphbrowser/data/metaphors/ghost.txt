In general, ghosts symbolizes aspects of yourself that you fear. This may involve a painful memory, guilt, or some repressed thoughts. You may be afraid of death and dying. Alternatively, ghosts are representative of something that is no longer obtainable or within reach. It indicates a feeling of disconnection from life and society. This dream may be a calling for you to move on and abandon your outdated modes of thinking and behavior.  Dreaming that you reach out to touch a ghost, but it disappears indicates that you are taking steps to acknowledging some painful or repressed thoughts even though you are not ready to fully confront them.  Seeing the ghost of a living relative or friend in your dream means that you are in danger of malice acts by that person.  Seeing the ghost of a dead friend/relative in your dream, suggests guilt and regrets concerning the past relationships with that particular person.
