Dreaming that you are in bondage means that aspects of your emotions and/or character are too tightly controlled or that are repressed. You may be restricting your need for self-expression or feel that you are a prisoner of your circumstances.  In a sexual sense, dreams of bondage represents your desires to be more sexually submissive or that you have unacknowledged sexual passions.
