Dreaming that you enter or are in a contest indicates the need to prove yourself as worthy and deserving. If you win the contest, then it represents your self-confidence, pride, and/or conceit.  If you lose the contest, then it indicates a lack of self-esteem. You may not be fully applying yourself to the task at hand.
