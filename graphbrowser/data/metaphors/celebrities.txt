Dreaming that you are a celebrity means your high aspirations that may be way beyond your reach at the present moment. You may just be setting yourself for a let-down.  Dreaming that a friend or lover becomes a celebrity means your fear of losing the friendship and loyalty of this person.  Seeing a celebrity in your dream, represents your beliefs and understanding about him or her. Something in you waking life has triggered these similar beliefs and feelings. It is not uncommon that your obsession with a certain celebrity may carry over onto your dream world. Celebrities are often seen as heroes and all that is mighty. Also consider any puns within the name.  Dreaming that you are good friends with a celebrity, represents your idealized version of someone you know in your life.  Perhaps you hope that a real-life friend can act more like a particular celebrity. Consider the qualities that you see in this celebrity and how you want your friends to have those qualities.
