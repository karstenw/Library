Dreaming that you are applying make-up means that you are trying to cover up or conceal a hidden aspect of yourself.  Alternatively, it may signify that you are putting on your best face forward. You are trying to enhance your self-image and increase your sense of self-confidence.  Dreaming that you are wearing too much make-up indicates that you are putting more emphasis on beauty and outside appearances rather than what is inside.
