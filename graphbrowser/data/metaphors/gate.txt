Seeing or passing through a gate in your dream, suggests that you are walking through a new phase of life. It also represents new opportunities and possibilities.  Seeing a closed gate in your dream means your inability to overcome current difficulties. If you are unable to open the gate, then it indicates that your hard work will be seen as unsatisfactory. It may also mean that you are not ready or not prepared to move on to the next step.
