Seeing or eating a cracker in your dream, suggests that you tend to care for the needs of others besides your own.  You spend your time looking of for other people and as a result, neglect your needs. The dream may also be a pun on "crack her". Perhaps you are trying to get someone to reveal certain information or secrets.
