Seeing letters of the alphabet in your dream, symbolizes any object, animal, place associated with or resembling that particular letter.  For example, the letter "T" may refer to a type intersection in a road. Alternatively, you may still be trying to understand some concept or emotion that is still in the primitive stages.
