Dreaming that you are walking on a sidewalk, your steady progress and direction in life. You may be moving on to new walks of life. If the sidewalk is cracked, then it means minor and temporary setbacks that are keeping you from getting to your destination. Your dream may suggest that you need to alter your course and make some changes in your life.
