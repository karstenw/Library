Dreaming that you have power indicates your growing confidence, high self-esteem and increasing skills. Alternatively, your dream of power may try to compensate for a waking situation in which you were powerless.  Dreaming that you do not have any power or feel powerless, refers to a waking situation in which you felt unable to do anything.
