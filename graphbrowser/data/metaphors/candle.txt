Seeing a burning candle in your dream means that good luck and hope will be coming your way in small and steady amounts. You are in a comfortable stage in your life and may be seeking spiritual enlightenment. Lit candles are also symbolic of intellect, enlightenment, awareness or the search for truth.  Seeing an unlit candle means that you have feelings or rejection or disappointments. You are not utilizing your fullest potential.  Seeing a candle blow out in your dream indicates that you are surrendering a significant aspect of yourself. You are letting go of something that used to be important to you.  To watch the candle burn down to nothing in your dream means your fears of aging and dying or a fear of sexual impotence.  Seeing a red colored candle in your dream, symbolizes some intimate or romantic relationship. You may not be giving the relationship a fair chance and are dismissing it before you invested time to learn more about the other person. On the other hand, you may just not be feeling any chemistry or passion.
