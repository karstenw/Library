Dreaming that you are laughing, suggests that you need to lighten up and let go of your problems.  Don't put so much pressure on yourself. Laughing is also a sign of joyous release and pleasure.  Hearing the cheerful laughter of children indicates splendid joy and vital health.  Hearing evil, demonic laughing in your dream, represents feelings of humiliation and/or helplessness.
