Dreaming that you are bowling, refers to the strikes, hits, and misses in your life. Perhaps you are expressing some regrets if you are bowling a bad game. And if you are bowling strike after strike, then it suggests that you are on your way toward a successful future.   It may also be a pun on your striking performance and/or stellar ability.  Dreaming that you bowl a gutter ball, suggests that you are stuck in a rut and need to make some changes of where your life is headed.  Alternatively, bowling and bowling alleys may also be a metaphor for sexual conquest.  Consider all the sexual innuendos that are at play in the bowling alley. The pin deck is symbolic of the womb or vagina (as is with with any dark receptacle like caves, bowls, containers, etc.)  The pins and bowling balls, can be viewed as masculine symbols.
