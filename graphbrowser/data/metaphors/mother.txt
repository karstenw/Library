Seeing your mother in your dream, represents the nurturing aspect of your own character. Mothers offer shelter, comfort, life, guidance and protection. Some people may have problems freeing themselves from their mothers and are thus seeking their own individuality and development.  Dreaming that you are having a conversation with your mother indicates a matter that has preoccupied your mind and you are not sure how to deal with it in your waking life. It indicates unresolved problems that still need to be worked out with your mother.  Hearing your mother call you in our dream means that you have been negligent in your duties and responsibilities.  You are pursuing down the wrong path.  Hearing your mother cry in your dream indicates some illness or affliction.
