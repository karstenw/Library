Seeing fruit in your dream means a period of growth, abundance and financial gain. Fruits generally represents lust and sexuality.  In particular green fruit in your dream indicates your hastiness and disappointed efforts. You need to work harder and longer in order to achieve your goals.  Seeing or eating rotting/bitter fruit, suggests your missed opportunities for growth and pleasure.  Dreaming that you buy or sell fruit means much business but little profit in them.
