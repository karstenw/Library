Seeing or wearing pajamas in your dream, suggests that you need to relax and get some rest. In particular, if you dream that you are wearing pajamas in public, then it means that you are unaware of some important that may be right in front of you. You may be just drifting through life without fully paying attention to what is going on around you.
