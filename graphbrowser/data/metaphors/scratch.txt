Dreaming that you are scratching yourself, symbolizes a minor irritation or frustration.  Perhaps something that began as minor may have the potential to become worse. Or that somebody may have hit a sore spot in you.  Seeing a scratch in your dream, suggests that you are feeling anxiety about having to start over or begin something "from scratch".
