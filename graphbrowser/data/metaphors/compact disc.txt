Seeing  a compact disc in your dream, represents a need for enjoyment or a distraction.  It means opportunities and possibilities. Consider the type of music and the title of the compact disc. If you are giving away the CD, you may be trying to convey a message to that person within the songs.  Consider also if the initial "CD" have any additional significance to you. Perhaps it represents a person or may even be a pun on something that is "seedy".
