Seeing a package in your dream, represents hidden creative energy, skills., and/or feelings. If you receive a package, it indicates that you are acknowledging certain feelings or acquiring new resources. If you are giving or sending a package, then it suggests that you are projecting your feelings onto another and not dealing with them.
