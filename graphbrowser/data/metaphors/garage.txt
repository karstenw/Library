Dreaming that you are in a garage means a period of inactivity and idleness in your life. You may feel that you have no direction or guidance toward achieving your goals.  Dreaming that you are pulling your car into the garage, represents security and stability brought about by your accomplishments and efforts.  Dreaming that you are opening the garage door indicates that you have made a decision about a matter. You may have decided on the path you will take in reaching  your opportunities and goals. On the other hand, if you are closing the garage door, then it suggests that you are putting off your goals for the sake of others around you.
