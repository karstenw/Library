Seeing a cake in your dream indicates that you need to learn to share and allocate your workload instead of trying to do everything yourself.  Cakes also symbolize selfishness or the feeling of not getting your fair share. More positively, the dream may represent your accomplishments and achievements. Consider also the metaphor a "piece of cake" or some situation that is easy.  Seeing a partially eaten cake in your dream means missed and lost opportunities.  Dreaming that you are buying a cake, suggests that you have accepted the rewards and recognition your are getting for our work.  You are learning to be comfortable in the spotlight.
