Seeing Santa Claus in your dream indicates that you need to be more giving, accepting, and/or forgiving. You need to acknowledge and tend to some aspect of yourself.  Dreaming that you or someone is dressed as Santa Claus, suggests that you need to treat others as you would like to be treated. Put yourself in someone else's shoe and determine how they might feel.
