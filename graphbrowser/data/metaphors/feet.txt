Seeing your own feet in your dream, symbolizes your foundation, stability and sense of understanding. It means your need to be more practical and sensible. Keep both feet on the ground. Alternatively, it represents mobility, independence and freedom. Perhaps you have taken a step in the right direction and are contemplating your goals or your next step.  The sole of the foot may be a pun of being or feeling like the only support of some person/situation.  Dreaming that you are washing your feet indicates that others can easily take advantage of you.  In particular for the people of India, to dream of the feet may symbolize divine qualities since the feet are considered the holiest part of the body.
