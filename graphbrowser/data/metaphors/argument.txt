When you dream that you are arguing with someone, it reflects the growing tensions in your relationship with that person. You might be expressing a need to exteriorate your frustration with that individual. Sometimes such dreams can be of a prophetic nature, and might warn you against some arguments you might be having with the person you saw in your dream.
