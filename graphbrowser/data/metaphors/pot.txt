Seeing a pot in your dream, represents your attitudes and may reveal hidden anger or frustration. Consider also how it may be a reference to marijuana and/or drug use.  Dreaming that the pot is boiling or bubbling over, suggests that you are filled with enthusiasm, excitement and/or ideas.  Alternatively, it may indicate that you have more than you can handle. You may be overwhelmed with emotions.
