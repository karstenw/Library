Dreaming that you are watching a movie, suggests that you are watching life pass you by. Perhaps you are living vicariously through the actions of others.  Consider also how the movie parallels to situations in your waking life. Observe how the characters relate to you and how they may represent an aspect of yourself.  Dreaming that you are playing a role in the movie, foretells that something from your unconscious is about to emerge or be revealed.  It may also represent memories of images or scenes from your past. Alternatively, the dream may be pointing you toward a new role that you might be undertaking. Your unconscious is psychologically preparing you for this new role.
