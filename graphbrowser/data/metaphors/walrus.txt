Seeing a walrus in your dream,  means protection and your display of dominance in some situation or relationship. You are always on the lookout for anybody who is trying to out-maneuver, out-rank, or out-wit you. Alternatively, the walrus may represent your thick-skin and how you do not let the comments/criticism of others get to you.  For Eskimos and Native Americans in the North, the walrus symbolizes supernatural ability and powers.
