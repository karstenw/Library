Seeing hay in your dream, represents the necessity of hard work; nothing in life comes easy. You may also be feeling hopeless about a situation.  Alternatively, hay indicates the need to nurture your maternal instincts, masculine energy, and/or your sexual urges. Consider also the symbol as a pun on "hey". Your dream may be trying to call your attention to something.
