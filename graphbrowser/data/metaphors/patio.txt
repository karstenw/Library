Dreaming that you are in the patio, suggests your openness toward a particular situation.  Dreaming that the doors to the patio are opened, represents your receptive state of mind. If they are closed, then it indicates that you are not being opened to a situation. Patio doors also represent the merging of your mental and spiritual state.
