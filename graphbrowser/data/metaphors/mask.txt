Dreaming that you are wearing a mask means temporary trouble as a result of some misunderstanding and misinterpretation of your actions and conduct. Alternatively, you may be pretending to be someone you are not or are hiding your true feelings.  Seeing others wearing a mask in your dream indicates that you will battle against deceit, falsehood, and jealousy.  Seeing others unmask in your dream, symbolizes failure in gaining the admiration and/or respect of someone sought for.
