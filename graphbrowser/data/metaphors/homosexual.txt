Dreaming that you are homosexual (but you are not in your waking life), represents a union with aspects of yourself. It is symbolic of self-love, self-acceptance, and compassion.  If, in your dream, you are not comfortable with homosexuality, then it suggests some fears/anxieties about your masculinity (if you are male) and femininity (if you are female). You may be experiencing some insecurity in your relations with the opposite sex.  Dreaming that the guy you like in real life is gay, represents your anxieties and fears that he won't like you back. If he was gay, then it would be easier  to dismiss your feelings for him. And it would be easier for you to say that you have no chance with him.  On a side note, it is common for expectant fathers to have dreams of homosexual encounters.  If you are homosexual in your waking life,  then the dream is simply a reflection of your own self.
