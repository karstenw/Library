Dreaming that you are harassed by an adversary implies that you will be the subject of some kind of agression directed against you or against your interests. By confronting such adversary, you are showing your readiness to defend yourself and to protect what is your own. If you dream that you are winning the battle, it indicates that you are getting yourself out of harms way.
