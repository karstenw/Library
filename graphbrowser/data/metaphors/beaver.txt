Dreaming of a beaver building a dam, symbolizes ambition and that hard work is necessary to achieve your own goals. It is time to put your ideas into action and settle any differences with fellow coworkers and friends. In isolating yourself from these people, you will find it difficult to attain your goals. The support of people around you are important.
