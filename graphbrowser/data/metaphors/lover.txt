Seeing a lover in your dream, symbolizes acceptance, self-worth, and acknowledgement of your true inner value. It may also indicate integration of masculine and feminine traits into yourself. You are feeling complete or whole.  Dreaming of an old or former lover means unfinished/unresolved issues related to that specific relationship. Your current relationship may be awakening some of those same issues.
