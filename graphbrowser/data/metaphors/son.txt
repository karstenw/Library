Seeing your son in your dream means your ideal, hopes, potential, and the youthful part of yourself. On the other hand, to see your son in your dream might not have any significance and is simply mirroring your waking life. The dream may also be a pun on "sun".  If you don't have a son and dream that you are searching for him, represents the undeveloped masculine aspect of your own self. You need to acknowledge the youth and child in you.
