Seeing a clear, calm-flowing river in your dream means that  you are allowing your life to float away and it is time that you take a more decisive hand in directing your life. A river also symbolizes joyful pleasures, peace and prosperity.  Seeing a raging river means that your life is feeling out of control.  Seeing a muddy and/or raging river means tumultuous times and jealousy in your life.  Seeing empty rivers in your dream, forewarns of sickness and unexpected bad luck.
