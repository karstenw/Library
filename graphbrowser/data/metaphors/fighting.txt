Dreaming that you participate in a fight indicates inner turmoil. Some aspect of yourself is in conflict with another aspect of yourself. Perhaps an unresolved or unacknowledged part is fighting for its right to be heard.  It may also parallel a fight or struggle that you are going through in your waking life.  Seeing others fighting in your dream, suggests that you are unwilling to acknowledge your own problems and turmoil. You are not taking any responsibility or initiative in trying to resolve issues in your waking life.  Dreaming that you are fighting to the death indicates that you are unwilling to acknowledge a waking conflict or your own inner turmoil.  You are unwilling and refusing to change your old attitudes and habits.
