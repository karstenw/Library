Dreaming that you are on a playground indicates your desires to escape from your daily responsibilities. Consider also objects in the playground as expressing or your need to express some aspect of yourself.  Perhaps you need to be more carefree or have some fun getting to know some of your talents and abilities that you have long ignored or disregarded.
