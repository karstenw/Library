Seeing a jigsaw puzzle in your dream, represents a mental challenge or a problem in your waking life that you need to solve. If there are pieces missing in the puzzle, then it suggests that you do not have all the facts in order to make a good and sound decision.  Seeing or doing a crossword puzzle, suggests that you are being faced with a mental challenge. The dream may be a pun on "cross words" directed at your or aimed toward someone.
