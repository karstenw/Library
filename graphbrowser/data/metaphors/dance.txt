Dreaming that you are dancing means freedom from constraints and harmony/balance with yourself. You are working in cooperation with yourself. It also represents frivolity, happiness, gracefulness, sensuality and sexual desires. Alternatively, it may signify intimacy and a union of the masculine and feminine aspects of yourself.  Dreaming that you are attending or going to a dance indicates a celebration and your attempts to achieve happiness. Consider the phrase the "dance of life" which suggests creation, ecstasy, and going with what life has to offer you.  Seeing children dancing in your dream means that you will have a comfortable home, and healthy, well-behaved children in the future.  Seeing ritualistic dancing in your dream indicates your need to get in touch with the spirit within..
