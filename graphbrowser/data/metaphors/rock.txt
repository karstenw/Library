Seeing rocks in your dream means permanence and stability as expressed in the familiar phrase "as solid as a rock". It may also indicate that you are making a commitment to a relationship. Or you may be contemplating some changes in your life  that will  lay the groundwork for a more solid foundation. On the other hand rocks may also symbolize stubbornness, disharmony and unhappiness.  Dreaming that you are climbing a steep rock means struggles, obstacles, and disappointments.
