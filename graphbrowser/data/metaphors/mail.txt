Dreaming that receive mail indicates that you need to communicate or  re-establish contact with someone from your present/past.  It may also represent messages from your unconscious or intuition. The mail may also be a pun on a "male" in your life.  If you receive mail from someone you don't know, then it suggests that some hidden aspect of yourself is trying to tell you something.
