To walk through a quiet, open path means clarity of thought and peace of mind. It may also symbolize your progress.  Seeing a blocked or windy path indicates that you need to give serious attention to the direction you are heading in your personal and/or business life. You also need to take time out to consider and rethink the consequences before acting on your choices.
