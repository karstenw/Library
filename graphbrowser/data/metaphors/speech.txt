To give a speech in your dream indicates that you need to vocalize your feelings and thoughts. You need to communicate something important and/or urgent. Alternatively, it may highlight your fear and nervousness of speaking in public.  Hearing a speech in your dream, suggests that your inner feelings are being made conscious to those around you. Consider what is said in the speech. If you hear a politician give a speech, then it represents egotism and deceit.
