Dreaming of a bottle means how you may be pushing your feelings back inside rather than expressing them. The contents of the bottle indicate the nature of the emotions. A bottle of champagne shows your need to socialize, while a bottle of poison means evil thoughts.  Dreaming of an empty bottle indicates that you have exhausted your inner resources. You may be feeling drained and empty inside.
