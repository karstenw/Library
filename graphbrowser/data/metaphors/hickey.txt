Dreaming that you have a hickey, represents a split between your rational thinking and your emotional thinking. You may be acting with your heart instead of thinking things out more clearly. Alternatively, you may be feeling emotionally or physically drained. You feel that you are giving too much of yourself in a relationship or situation.
