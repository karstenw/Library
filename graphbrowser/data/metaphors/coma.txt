Dreaming that you are in a coma indicates your helplessness and inability to function in some given situation. You are not prepared for the major changes that are happening around you. Alternatively, your dream coma state may reflect what is really happening to you body when you are in the dream stage of sleep. In this stage of sleep, our bodies remain immobile as if it was paralyzed, commonly known as REM paralysis.
