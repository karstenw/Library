Seeing the floor in your dream, represents your support. It may also represent the division between the unconscious and conscious.  Seeing a polished, wooden floor in your dream indicates that you are fully aware of your unconscious and keeping it suppressed.  Seeing a slanted floor in your dream, foretells that you are deviating too far from your original plans and goals.
