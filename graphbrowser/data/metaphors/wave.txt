Seeing clear, calm  waves in your dream means a calming of emotions. It may also signal an important decision to be made.  Hearing waves crashing in your dream indicates tenderness and relaxation. It also brings about feelings of sensuality and sexuality.  Dreaming that you are caught in a tidal wave means the strength of your emotions, perhaps accompanied by tears that you are holding back in your waking life.  Seeing muddy, violent  waves in your dream means that a fatal error was made in an important decision.
