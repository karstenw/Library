Dreaming that you are in a theater means that you will derive much pleasure from new companionships. Consider also how the performance parallels to situations in your waking life. Observe how the characters relate to you and how they may represent an aspect of yourself. You may be taking on a new role.  Dreaming that you are laughing and/or applauding in a theater indicates that you tend to choose pleasure and instant gratification over working on future goals.  Dreaming that the theater is on fire means that any new projects you take on will be risky.
