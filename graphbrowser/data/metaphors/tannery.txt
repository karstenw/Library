Seeing a tannery in your dream, forewarns that you will catch some contagious disease.  Dreaming that you are a tanner means that you have to engage in some work which is not what you want to do, but must continue to work for the livelihood of those dependant on you.  Dreaming that you are buying leather goods from the tannery, foretells that you will make little friends on your path to success and to the top of the social ladder.
