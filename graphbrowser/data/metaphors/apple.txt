Apples are symbol of fertility, growth, love and prosperity. Eating an apple means you are enjoying life and will be tasting the fruit of success, in your love life or even at your workplace.  There is also the biblical reference, Adam eating the apple, which deals with the sexual dimension: forbidden love, repressed desires, sweet temptations.
