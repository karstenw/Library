Dreaming that you are entering through a door means new opportunities that will be presented before you. You are entering into a new stage in your life and moving from one level of consciousness to another. In particular, a door that opens to the outside means your need to be more accessible to others, whereas a door that opens into the inside indicates your desire for inner exploration and self-discovery.  Seeing opened doors in your dream, symbolizes your receptiveness and willingness to accept new ideas/concepts. In particular, to see a light behind it suggests that you are moving toward greater enlightenment/spirituality.  Dreaming that the doors are locked means opportunities that are denied and not available to you or that you have missed out on. In particular, if you are outside the locked door, then it suggests that you are having some anti-social tendencies. If you are inside the locked door, then it represents harsh lessons that need to be learned.  Dreaming that you are locking doors, suggests that you are closing yourself off from others. You are hesitant in letting others in and revealing your feelings. It is indicative of some fear and low self-worth.  Seeing revolving doors in your dream, suggests that you are literally moving in circles and going no where. You may feel that your opportunities and choices lead to a dead end.
