The first approach to explaining dreaming of an accident is to consider it as a warning for possible future traffic accidents. You might be rehearsing a dangerous situation that you could have avoided if you would have been more cautious. Maybe it is time to slow down, and face your fears and doubts, are you still in control, is there any built up guilt? When someone you know dies in an accident in your dream, you might want to consider the nature of your relationship with that person, it might need some serious mending.
