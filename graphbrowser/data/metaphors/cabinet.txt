Dreaming of a cabinet symbolizes the female body and/or the womb. Alternatively, you may be hiding some family or personal secret. The contents and condition of the cabinet should give more indication of the meaning of your dream.  Dreaming of someone rearranging your cabinets suggests that somebody is overstepping your boundaries.
