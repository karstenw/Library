Seeing windows in your dream means bright hopes, vast  possibilities and insight.  Dreaming that you are looking out the window means your outlook on life, your consciousness, point of view, awareness, and intuition. You may be reflecting on a decision and seeking guidance. If  you are looking in the window, then it indicates that you are doing some soul searching and looking within yourself.  Seeing shut windows in your dream means desertion and abandonment.  Seeing shattered and broken windows indicates misery and disloyalty.  Seeing a tinted window in your dream, represents you need for privacy and your ways of getting it. You are keeping aspects of yourself hidden or that you want to remain ambiguous.
