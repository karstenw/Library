Seeing your toes in your dream, represents the way you move and walk through life with such grace and poise (or there lack of).  It also signify your path in life. Alternatively, toes may also represent the minor detail of life and how you deal with them.  Dreaming that your toe nails are growing, symbolize an extension of your understanding in a particular matter.  Dreaming that you lose or gain a toe(s), suggests that you lack determination and energy needed to move forward in some situation.  Dreaming that you hurt your toe or that there is a corn or abrasion on it means that you are feeling anxiety about moving forward with something.  Dreaming that someone is kissing your toe indicates that they are trying to reassure and reaffirm your progress forward.
