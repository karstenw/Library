Seeing or driving a station wagon in your dream, refers to your family and issues surrounding your family.  Dreaming that you are unable to roll up the windows of your station wagon, represents your anxieties about being able to protect and provide for your family. You are showing some hesitation and reservation about the direction that you are taking in life or the path that you have chosen.
