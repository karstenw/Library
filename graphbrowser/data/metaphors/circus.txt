Dreaming that you are having a terrific time at a circus means your satisfaction and contentment with your current surroundings. But to dream that you are just at the circus means that you are being misunderstood in some way. You are giving off the wrong impression to others.  Dreaming that there is chaos at the circus means that your life is out of control.
