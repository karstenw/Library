Seeing a scarf in your dream, symbolizes self-restrictions. You may be too controlling of your emotions instead of expressing them. Or you may feel that your voice is being muffled.  Dreaming that you are wearing a scarf, suggests that you are separating your mind from your body. You may be relying too much on how you think, rather than how you feel or vice versa. Alternatively, you need to tell yourself that it is mind over matter.
