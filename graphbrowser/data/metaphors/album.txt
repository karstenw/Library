When you dream you are going through the pictures in an album, it reflects your longing to past memories and experiences. Maybe you are missing someone or something in your life, but are you sure you are not remembering the positive aspects only, and forgetting the less positive ones?  If you dream of an album and you do not look through it, it means that you can count on your good friends, there are there for you.
