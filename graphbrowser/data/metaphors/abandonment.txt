Dreams of being abandonned often reflect feelings of low self-esteem and undesirability more than literal concerns of betrayal or desertion. If we have been feeling low or have suffered a setback in our romantic or professional life, this dream is a call to action. It is time to identify your goals, so you can feel better about yourself and leave these dreams behind!
