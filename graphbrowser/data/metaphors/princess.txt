Dreaming that you are a princess indicates that you are recognizing your full potential. You still need to grow more and develop your full character. Alternatively, you may be too demanding and perhaps acting like a spoiled brat.  For a male, to see a princess in your dream, represents his sister or an important female figure in your life. It also suggests your desires for the ideal woman.
