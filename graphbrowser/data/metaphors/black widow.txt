Dreaming of a black widow, suggests fear or uncertainty regarding a relationship. You may feel confined, trapped, or suffocated in this relationship. You may even have some hostility toward your mate.  Because the female black widow has the reputation of devouring its mate, it thus also symbolizes feminine power and domination over men.
