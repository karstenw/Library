Dreaming that you are in a parachute means that you have protection and security during a time in which many risks and turmoil surround you. Alternatively, it may also imply that it is time to bail out of a situation or abandon an old idea/habit.  Dreaming that you have difficulties with a parachute indicates that you will be let down by someone you relied on and trusted.
