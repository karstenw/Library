Dreaming of a baby being baptized represents renewal and a new way of being, a new attitude toward life, or a new approach toward others. Immersion in water represents death, whereas emergence means resurrection and a new life. You have let go of your old negative you and this new you will likely be successful.  On a spiritual note, this dream means your renewed faith in God and that you are coming closer to self-realization and spiritual fulfillment.
