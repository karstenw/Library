Seeing a castle in your dream means reward, honor, recognition, and praise for your achievements. It foretells that your future will be a happy one, surrounded by the love of your children, generosity of neighbors, and comfort of friends.  You are destined to a position of power, wealth, and prestige.  Dreaming that you live in a castle means your need for security and protection to the point where you may be isolating yourself from others.
