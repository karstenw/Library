Seeing your legs in your dream means that you have regained confidence to stand up and take control again. It also implies progress and your ability to navigate through life. If your legs are weak, then you may be feeling emotionally vulnerable.  Seeing someone else's legs in your dream,  represents your admiration for that person. You need to adopt some of the ways that this person does things.  Dreaming that you legs are wounded or crippled means a lack of balance, autonomy, or independence in your life. You may be unable or unwilling to stand up for yourself. Perhaps you are lacking courage and refuse to make a stand.  Dreaming that one of your leg is shorter than the other, suggests that there is some imbalance in some aspect of your life. You are placing more emphasis and weight on one thing, while ignoring other important aspects that need attention as well.  Dreaming that you have three or more legs indicates that you are undertaking too many projects than you can  handle. Unfortunately, you will find these projects to be unfruitful and a waste of time.
