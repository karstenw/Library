Dreaming about the weather means your emotional state of mind. Stormy or windy weather implies conflict and aggression. Rain and hail represents depression and sadness. And rainbows and sunshine means hope and happiness.  Dreaming that you are reading the weather report, foretells that you will move from your current resident.
