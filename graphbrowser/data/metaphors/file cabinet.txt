Seeing a file cabinet in your dream, suggests that you need to keep your facts and information straight. The file cabinet may also represent the memories or unnecessary details you keep stored in your mind  and need to retrieve from time to time.  Dreaming that the drawers of the file cabinet are wide open indicates your openness toward other viewpoints, opinions, suggestions, and criticism.  Dreaming that the file cabinet is locked indicates that there is something that you do not want revealed to others. Alternatively, it may indicate that you are being close-minded.
