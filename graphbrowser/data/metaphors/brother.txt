Dreaming of your brother, may symbolize some aspect of your relationship with him. It can also serve to remind you that someone in your waking life has certain characteristics/behavior similar to your brother's.  If you do not have a brother and dream that you have one, then he may symbolize characteristics that you need to acknowledge within yourself.  The brother can also be synonymous with a close friend or buddy.  Brother also has religious implications and thus represents spiritual issues. Consider also the familiar phrase "big brother is watching you" which indicate that your dream has to deal with issues of authority and oppression.  Dreaming that you are mad or angry at your brother means repressed anger that you are feeling but afraid to express in your waking life.
