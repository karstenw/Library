Dreaming that you are in a cult, suggests that you are in some destructive and/or manipulative relationship. You are being exploited. On a more positive note, you have the desire to strive for a better Self. It implies devotion and sense of community.  Seeing a cult in your dream indicates that you are lacking any spiritual freedom.  Dreaming that you are a leader of a cult means your authoritarian attitude.  No one should question your motives or choices.
