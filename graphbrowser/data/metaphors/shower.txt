Dreaming that you are taking a shower in clear, fresh water indicates spiritual or physical renewal or the need to wash a burden out of your life. It is also symbolic of forgiveness.  Dreaming that you are taking a shower in muddy, dirty water means misfortune and minor losses.  Dreaming that you (or someone) is showering with their clothes on, suggests that even though you (or someone) change your outer appearances, it does not change who you are on the inside. Alternatively, your dream may indicate that you are unwilling to let your guard down. You are still keeping up a protective barrier between you and others.
