Seeing mud in your dream, suggests that you are involved in a messy and sticky situation. It also suggests that some internal cleansing is needed.  Dreaming that you are walking in mud, suggests that you are feeling weighed down by a situation, problem, or relationship.  Dreaming that mud has gotten on your clothing means that your reputation is being attacked and called into question. Consider the term "mud-slinging" to refer to some politicians.
