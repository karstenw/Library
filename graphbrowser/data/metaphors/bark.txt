To hear barking in your dream represents your tendency of barking orders at people instead of asking or talking kindly. It may also indicate that you are annoying others, grumpiness, or fussiness.  Dreaming of a happily barking dog, symbolizes pleasures and much social activity.  If the dog is barking ferociously, then it represents your habit of unnecessary barking at people and the situations around you. It could also mean unfriendly companions.
