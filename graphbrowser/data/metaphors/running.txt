Dreaming that you are running away from someone indicates an issue that you are trying to avoid. You are not taking or accepting responsibility for your actions. In particular, if you are running from an attacker or any danger, then it suggests that you are not facing and confronting your fears.  Dreaming that you are trying to run but cannot make your feet move as fast as you want them to means lack of self-esteem and self-confidence. It may also reflect your actual state of REM paralysis while in the dream state.  Dreaming that you are running alone means that you will advance to a higher position and surpass your friends in the race for wealth. Alternatively, you may be running from some situation or from temptation.  Dreaming that you are running with others means festive and prosperous times.
