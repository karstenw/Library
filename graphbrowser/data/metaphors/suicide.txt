Dreaming that you commit suicide indicates that conditions in your life is so frustrating that you are no longer willing to cope with a situation or relationship in the same way as you did in the past. Alternatively, you may be unable to overcome feelings of guilt and thus turning the aggression on yourself.  On a more positive note, it may suggest that you are saying good-bye to one aspect of yourself or character that your have been carrying around.  Seeing someone commit suicide in you dream, highlights your concerns for that person. Also consider what characteristics and qualities in that person  you may be trying to "kill" and annihilate in your own self.  Perhaps you hope that you are not like that person in some way and are making attempts to get rid of those traits within your own self.
