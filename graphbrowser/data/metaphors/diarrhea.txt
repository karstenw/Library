Dreaming that you have diarrhea means that some part of your life is going out of control or that you can no longer contain your strong emotions.  Alternatively, it may indicate a need for you to get something out of your system quickly.  It may also indicate that you have not analyzed a situation long enough or that you do not want to deal with the problem at all.
