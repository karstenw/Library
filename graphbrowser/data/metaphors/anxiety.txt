When you dream of anxiety, it might be a reflection of a real anxiety in your own life. You might be conscious of your state or your suffering might be repressed in your inner self. In both cases, you should try to let go of the steam, to deal with your emotions, or it will lead you to commit mistakes in your love life and in your professional life. And it is certainly not the time to mix thes two together.
