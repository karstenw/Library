Seeing racism in your dream indicates that you may be too judgmental and discriminatory in some situation of your waking life. Perhaps you have falsely pre-judged someone because of the way he or she appeared.  Dreaming that you are racist indicates your unwillingness and refusal to be pushed aside. You refuse to be dismissed.  If you believe in racism, then the dream is a reflection of your waking ideals and beliefs.
