Seeing a stoplight in your dream, suggests that you feel you are being held back from pursuing your goals. You may also feel pressure to succeed or else be left behind.  If the stoplight is green, then it indicates that you have been given a seal of approval to follow whatever path you have chosen or whatever decision you have made.
