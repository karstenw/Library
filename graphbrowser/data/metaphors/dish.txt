Seeing dishes in your dream, represents  ideas, concepts, and attitudes. It may also be a fun for what you are "dishing" out to others.  If the dishes are dirty and unwashed, then it means dissatisfaction and an unpromising outlook. You may have overlooked some problems in your life or you have not confronted your emotions.  Dreaming that you are washing dishes, suggests that you are moving on and planning for the next thing that comes your way.  Seeing shelves of polished dishes, suggests that you are doing your best and making the best out of a situation. You are trying to make a good impression.  Seeing broken dishes in your dream means feelings of poverty, lack, and inadequacy. You may feel that you are not meeting the expectations of others.
