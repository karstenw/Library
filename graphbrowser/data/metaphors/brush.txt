Dreaming of a brush, symbolizes your desire to brush away problems or something in your life that needs to be cleaned up. Perhaps you are taking a nonchalant attitude to circumstances that need serious consideration.  If you lose or can't find your brush, then suggests that you are unable to sort our your problems.
