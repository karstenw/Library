Dreaming of a broom indicates that it is time to clean up your act and resolve your past issues. You need to discard what is no longer useful to you. Alternatively, brooms symbolize domesticity and the establishment of a household. Also, brooms are sometimes associated with witches and thus broomsticks may refer to the female shadow aspect of yourself.
