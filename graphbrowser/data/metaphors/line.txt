Seeing a line in your dream, symbolizes duality. It also relates to movement or non-movement. A line also represents limits and boundaries. And thus to dream that you are crossing a line, suggest that you are overstepping your boundaries or that you are moving beyond any limits.  Seeing a line of people or objects indicates that you need to be more aware of some situation or relationship.  Dreaming that you are standing in line indicates your need for patience. You should be prepared to wait for something and not have it right away.
