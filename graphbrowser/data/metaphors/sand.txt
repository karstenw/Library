Seeing sand in your dream means a shift in perspective or a change in your attitude. Consider also the familiar phrase, "the sands of time" in which it may be suggesting that you are wasting your time or letting time pass you by.  Seeing wet sand in your dream indicates that you are lacking a sense of balance in your life.
