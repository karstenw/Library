Dreaming of cosuming alcohol in great quantities, and losing control, may reflect a need for you to hide some negative feelings you have about yourself, or about someone else, if you see him/her getting drunk.  When you are dreaming of drinking to excess, maybe you are trying to escape reality, hide a feeling of guilt or regret.  It might also underline the need for you to let go of your inhibitions and just express yourself with no shame, as if you were a different person. If you are dreaming that you are feeling happy and still in control when consuming alcohol, it means that you will be soon hearing good news of success and achievement.
