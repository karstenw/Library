Dreaming that you are camping, suggests your need for relaxation and a long-deserved break.  You may be looking to be more in touch with nature and for a simpler life. Alternatively, it refers to your social circle and support group. You need to have a sense of belonging, but at the same time be self-sufficient and independent.
