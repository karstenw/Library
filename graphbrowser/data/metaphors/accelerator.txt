Dreaming of an accelerator (gas pedal) means that you are in control and you will be relying on your own strength and efforts to reach your goals. If, on the other hand, the accelerator is jammed or malfunctioning, then it means that you are losing control of an aspect of your life such as a bad habit which you cannot seem to stop.
