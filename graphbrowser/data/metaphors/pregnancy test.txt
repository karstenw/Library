Dreaming that you are taking a pregnancy test, may be a metaphor for a new phase you are entering in your life (a new job, relationship, etc.) You may feel that you are being put to the test as to whether you are prepared or ready for these changes.  Alternatively, this dream may be literal in meaning and address your anxieties/fears of getting pregnant.
