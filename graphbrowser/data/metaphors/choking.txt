Dreaming that you are choking on an object, suggests that you may find some advice/remarks/situation hard to swallow or difficult to accept. Alternatively, you may feel that you are unable to completely express yourself in a situation. In particular, if you are choking on food, then it may be an expression of self-guilt and unnurtured feelings.  Dreaming that someone is choking you indicates that you are suppressing your emotions or that you may have difficulties in expressing your fears, anger, or love. Consider the phrase "being all choked up". Alternatively, you may feel that you are being prevented or restricted from freely expressing yourself.  Dreaming that you are choking someone means feelings of aggression. You may also be trying to prevent something from being said or revealed.  Choking dreams are often a fearful experience and it is not uncommon for dreamers to awaken from them.
